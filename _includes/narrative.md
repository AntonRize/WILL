Theories of relativity and quantum mechanics describe the world with incredible precision, from subatomic particles to cosmic horizons. Yet, in this very foundation, there remain enigmatic elements that cast a shadow over the completeness of our understanding: gravitational singularities where known laws break down; arbitrary constants we can measure but cannot explain; and the necessity to introduce “dark” entities such as dark matter and dark energy simply to align theory with observation. These phenomena indicate that our description of reality may be incomplete.</p><p>Against this backdrop, a fundamental question arises: What if we could construct the Universe without any “extraneous details”? What if all observable phenomena—space, time, mass, energy—could be derived from a single, simple, and self-evident statement, without the need for free parameters or inexplicable constants? This approach—what might be called the principle of “epistemological hygiene”—demands that we reject all assumptions not strictly necessary, and build the theory solely on the basis of logical sequence.</p><p>It is on this path of uncompromising minimalism that the central, unifying postulate of WILL Geometry is born:</p><blockquote class="text-2xl text-center font-bold text-white py-4">SPACETIME ≡ ENERGY EVOLUTION</blockquote><p>At first glance, this statement appears simple, but it carries a revolutionary meaning. It asserts that space and time are not some pre-existing “container” or stage on which physical processes unfold. On the contrary, the very fabric of spacetime is identical to the full structure of all possible transitions and interconnections between energetic states. Spacetime is not a stage; it is the dance itself. Energy does not exist in spacetime; rather, it defines it through its own projections and relations.</p><p>This work is not merely a reformulation of existing theories, but rather a narrative account of this new perspective—born from a personal quest to understand the fundamental nature of reality based on the most elementary geometric principles. It is an intellectual journey motivated by the conviction that the Universe’s structure must, at its core, be simple, elegant, and logically closed. The aim of this narrative is not to refute established physics, but to offer a deeper perspective—showing how the known laws of special and general relativity can be not merely postulated, but derived as inevitable consequences of a single, more fundamental principle. We will trace the logical chain from this lone postulate to its ultimate conclusions, demonstrating how it gives rise to all the complexity and beauty of the relativistic world.</p></section>{% elsif include.part == 'section2' %}<section id="section-2"><h2 class="text-3xl">Section 2: The Rules of the Game — A Foundation of Pure Logic</h2><p>If we accept the fundamental postulate—that spacetime is identical to energy evolution—we are immediately confronted with its strict logical consequences. First and foremost: if all of reality is a self-sufficient system of energetic relations, then by definition nothing can exist “outside” this system. There is no external observer, no absolute reference frame or background on which events unfold. The Universe of WILL Geometry must be entirely closed and self-sufficient.</p><p>This restriction, philosophical at first glance, generates concrete physical and geometric “rules of the game”:</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li><strong>Conservation Law:</strong> In a closed system, nothing can appear from outside or disappear without a trace. This means that the total energy of the system must be conserved. The law of conservation is not an added assumption, but a direct consequence of the Universe’s self-sufficiency.</li><li><strong>Symmetry:</strong> In the absence of external reference points, no location in space and no direction can be privileged from the outset. Any asymmetry would require a preferred frame, contradicting our foundational principle. Therefore, the geometry of the Universe must be maximally symmetric.</li></ul><p>This immediately raises the question: What geometric structures satisfy these strict requirements—being both closed and maximally symmetric? Mathematics gives a definitive answer. Among all possible manifolds, only certain forms possess these properties to perfection.</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li>In one dimension, the only such form is the circle (S1).</li><li>In two dimensions—the surface of a sphere (S2).</li></ul><p>These geometries are not arbitrary choices or convenient models. They are forced upon us by the logic of the postulate itself. If the Universe is a closed and symmetric system of energetic relations, then any projections of those relations must “live” on these unique surfaces. The circle and the sphere become the only possible “canvases” on which the picture of physical reality can be drawn.</p><p>Finally, we must rethink one of the fundamental constants of nature—the speed of light, c. In WILL Geometry, c is not merely the speed at which photons travel. It is the universal speed of evolution, the fundamental tempo of change in the Universe itself. Every interaction, every transformation of energy, occurs at this single, invariant rate. This universal “speed of evolution” is like a vector of constant length. The various physical processes we observe are merely projections of this single vector onto different axes, just as a car’s velocity can be decomposed into northward and eastward motion. The sum of the squares of the projections always remains constant, naturally returning us to the geometry of the circle, where the radius (c) is invariant.</p><p>Thus, from a single postulate, we derive the entire set of rules: conservation, symmetry, and specific geometric structures (the circle and the sphere) that will serve as the arena for all subsequent physical phenomena. Geometry is not imposed upon physics; it is its inevitable logical consequence.</p></section>{% elsif include.part == 'section3_intro' %}<section id="section-3"><h2 class="text-3xl">Section 3: Act I – Motion as a Shadow on the Circle (Special Relativity)</h2><p>Now that the rules of the game have been established, let’s consider the simplest case: one-dimensional motion. According to our logic, this process must be described on the only possible closed and symmetric 1D geometry—the circle. This act of our narrative is devoted to reconstructing special relativity (SR) using nothing but these geometric tools. The main character here is the kinetic projection, denoted by the Greek letter beta (beta).</p><p>Imagine a unit circle whose radius symbolizes the universal speed of evolution, c, which for simplicity we set to 1. Any state of motion of an object can be represented as a point on this circle. The total “speed of evolution” is a vector drawn from the center to this point. This vector can be decomposed into horizontal (X axis) and vertical (Y axis) projections.</p>{% elsif include.part == 'section3_motion_time' %}<h3 class="text-2xl">How Motion and Time Are Just Two Sides of the Same Thing</h3><p>Imagine all possible states of movement as points around a perfect circle. The radius of this circle is the fastest possible speed in the universe — the universal “speed of change.” Every moving object is like a pointer from the center of the circle to some spot on its edge.</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li><strong>Movement:</strong> How fast something moves through space is just “how much” of that pointer is aimed sideways around the circle. The faster it goes, the more it “leans” into space, and the less is left “pointing” upward — toward time.</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> How fast time ticks for something is just “how much” of that pointer is aimed along the time direction. If the object speeds up through space, less of the pointer is left for time — so its time slows down.</li></ul><p>Think of it like sharing a fixed budget: If you spend more of your “change” moving through space, you have less left for moving through time.</p><details><summary>Show Math</summary>The relationship between space and time projections is just Pythagoras’ theorem for a unit circle:β=v/c=cos(θS​)sin(θS​)=1−β2​</details>{% elsif include.part == 'section3_emc2' %}<h3 class="text-2xl">How E = mc² Falls Out Naturally</h3><p>Here’s the coolest part: That famous equation, E=mc2, isn’t some magic law — it’s just what you get when you realize energy and mass are two sides of the same coin. At rest, all of an object’s energy points along the time direction. When it moves, some energy “tilts” into space — but the total stays balanced, so that the piece along time remains constant.</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li><strong>Mass</strong> is just a way to relate an object’s energy at rest to its fundamental “speed of change.”</li><li><strong>Energy</strong> increases as the object moves, simply to keep the system in balance.</li></ul><details><summary>Show Math</summary>Total energy: E=γmc2Rest energy: E0​=mc2Momentum: p=γmv</details>{% elsif include.part == 'section3_triangle_intro' %}<h3 class="text-2xl">The Energy-Momentum Triangle</h3><p>Visualize energy, mass, and momentum as a simple right triangle:</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li><strong>One side</strong> (fixed) always represents the object's rest energy — this never changes, no matter how fast it moves.</li><li><strong>The second side</strong> grows as the object’s speed increases — this is its momentum.</li><li><strong>The hypotenuse</strong> is the total energy — it stretches as you go faster.</li></ul><blockquote>When you slide the velocity, you can see how “momentum” grows, and total energy stretches to keep the triangle in perfect balance, but rest energy always stays the same.</blockquote>{% elsif include.part == 'section3_outro' %}<h3 class="text-2xl">What This Means</h3><p>Special relativity stops being a bunch of rules about “strange time effects” or “postulates about light.” Instead, it’s just a simple story of how all things must share a fixed “budget” of change between motion and time. Mass, energy, and momentum are simply three perspectives on the same underlying geometric fact.</p></section>{% elsif include.part == 'section4_intro' %}<section id="section-4"><h2 class="text-3xl">Section 4: Act II – Gravity as a Shadow on the Sphere</h2><p>Having cracked motion using a simple circle, let’s tackle gravity. Gravity is different: instead of working in one direction, like motion, it pulls equally from every side — like being surrounded in all directions. So our “canvas” has to be not a line or circle, but a whole <strong>sphere</strong>.</p><h3 class="text-2xl">How Gravity is Just a Different Kind of Projection</h3><p>Imagine standing at the center of a big sphere — gravity “spreads out” the same in every direction from the mass at the center.</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li>To measure “how much” gravity there is, we use a new slider — let’s call it <strong>kappa</strong> (kappa).</li><li>kappa tells us how close you are to the point where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape — the edge of a black hole.</li></ul>{% elsif include.part == 'section4_gravity_time' %}<h3 class="text-2xl">How Gravity Warps Time</h3><p>Here’s where the sphere magic happens: As you get closer to a massive object, kappa goes up, and time starts to slow down. If you reach the event horizon (kappa=1), time (from an outside view) stops completely.</p><blockquote>Gravity isn’t just pulling you in — it’s literally changing how fast your clock ticks, depending on where you are.</blockquote><details><summary>Show Math</summary>Time dilation near a massive object is:1−κ​=1−RS​/r​=1−2GM/(rc2)​</details>{% elsif include.part == 'section4_outro' %}<h3 class="text-2xl">The Hidden Symmetry</h3><p>Here’s the coolest part:</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li>Time-slowing by moving fast (special relativity) and by being near gravity (general relativity) are really the SAME effect, just from different geometric “views.”</li><li>Both are about how much of your “change budget” gets “spent” in different directions.</li></ul><table><thead><tr><th>Situation</th><th>Geometry</th><th>Time Slowdown Formula</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Moving fast (SR)</strong></td><td>Circle</td><td>sqrt1−beta2</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Near mass (GR)</strong></td><td>Sphere</td><td>sqrt1−kappa</td></tr></tbody></table><p>So, what looks like two separate “mysteries” in physics are actually just two projections of the same fundamental story.</p><h3 class="text-2xl">✦ Energy as a Relation — What κ and β Actually Mean</h3><h4><strong>Key Principle:</strong></h4><p><strong>Energy isn't something objects "have"—it's a measure of differences between states.</strong></p><p>When we drop anthropocentric distortions, a clear and intuitive picture emerges:</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li>Physical parameters like energy, speed, and gravitational potential don't belong to objects.</li><li>Instead, they represent how we, as observers, measure differences from our own point of view.</li></ul><p>In this relational view, your perspective is always the reference frame. You are always at zero. Everything else is described by how it differs from your state:</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li><strong>beta (Beta)</strong> is not an intrinsic property of a moving object. It is a measure of how much of the universal "speed of change" you see as motion through space, relative to yourself.</li><li><strong>kappa (Kappa)</strong> doesn't describe an object's "stored" gravitational energy. It measures how deeply an object sits in a gravitational field, as seen from your position. It's your personal "ruler" for gravitational depth.</li></ul><p>Think of kappa and beta as your own relational measuring tools:</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li><strong>beta</strong> is how far along your "motion ruler" you project another object's state.</li><li><strong>kappa</strong> is how deep into your "gravity well" you see another object's state.</li></ul><p>Energy thus emerges naturally:</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li>Energy is simply the capacity to move between states—it's not possessed, but relationally defined.</li><li>Saying "the object's energy" always implicitly means "the object's energy as measured from your perspective."</li></ul><blockquote>Imagine standing on a train platform. A train passes by rapidly: to you, it has significant kinetic energy. But if you jump onto the train, it instantly becomes stationary relative to you. Its kinetic energy is now zero—because your frame of reference shifted.

But here’s the twist: <strong>these two worlds aren’t really separate.</strong> In fact, there’s a deep, built‑in connection between them. They’re just different “faces” of one and the same thing.</p><h3 class="text-2xl">The Universal “Budget” Principle</h3><p>Imagine you have a bucket of paint. You can use it to draw a line around a circle (one‑dimensional) or you can use it to cover the surface of a sphere (two‑dimensional). No matter how you use it, your total paint doesn’t change — but the way it “spreads” over these shapes is fundamentally different. This is exactly what happens with energy in the universe:</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li>Sometimes it shows up as motion (moving around the circle)</li><li>Sometimes as gravity (spread over the sphere)</li></ul><p>But both are just different ways of splitting up the same “energy budget.”</p><details><summary>Show the key connection</summary>The “paint” covering for both shapes leads to a simple rule:κ2=2β2orβ2κ2​=2where<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li>beta2 = “share” spent on motion</li><li>kappa2 = “share” spent on gravity</li></ul></details><h3 class="text-2xl">Why does it matter?</h3><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li>This isn’t some made‑up or “fit” formula.</li><li>It pops out just from how geometry itself works — how lines and surfaces relate.</li><li>Even old-school physics quietly hinted at this (for example, the escape velocity in Newton’s gravity, v_e2=2v_orb2).</li></ul><p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Motion and gravity are two sides of the same coin. Their relationship isn’t an accident — it’s a built‑in, geometric law of how the universe splits up its “energy resources.” This is why they can’t ever be truly separated, and why geometry is the hidden glue in everything.</p><h3 class="text-2xl">Where Does the “2” Come From?</h3><p>All this talk about “budgeting” between circles and spheres leads to a natural question: <strong>Why exactly “2”? Where does it come from?</strong></p><p>Here’s the simple geometric truth:</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li>The circle (our 1D case for motion) has a circumference of 2π (for a unit radius).</li><li>The sphere (our 2D case for gravity) has a surface area of 4π (for a unit radius).</li></ul><p>So when we ask, “How many times does a circle fit into a sphere?” the answer is:</p><details><summary>Show the calculation</summary>Circumference of circleSurface area of sphere​=2π4π​=2</details><p>That’s the source of the mysterious “2” in our key equation. It’s not an arbitrary fudge factor — it’s pure geometry.</p><h3 class="text-2xl">How It Ties Together</h3><p>So when energy splits between motion (on the circle) and gravity (on the sphere), the “budget” gets shared according to this built-in, topological ratio. The key relationship: κ2=2β2 just says: <em>“Gravity’s share is always twice the motion’s share, because a sphere’s surface area is twice the length of a circle’s perimeter, at the most fundamental geometric level.”</em></p><p><strong>In short:</strong> The “2” isn’t magic, it’s the deep fingerprint of geometry itself, forever tying together movement and gravity in the universe.</p><p>A remarkable consequence of this unification happens at a special “balance point” — where the two projections, kinetic and potential, are perfectly matched. This occurs when: κ2+β2=1 and the two angles are exactly equal. <strong>At this moment, something amazing appears: it matches the “photon sphere” — the special zone around a massive object where light itself can orbit in a perfect circle.</strong> (For a black hole, that’s at a distance of 1.5 times its radius.)</p><details><summary>What happens to light at the photon sphere?</summary><p>At the photon sphere, a photon moving exactly along the perfect circle could orbit forever — but this path is incredibly unstable. If the photon’s path points even a tiny bit outward, it escapes to infinity. If it’s angled a bit inward, it falls into the black hole. So, the photon sphere is not a prison — it’s a tightrope. Light can still escape if it’s not traveling exactly along the circle.</p></details></section>{% elsif include.part == 'section6' %}<section id="section-6"><h2 class="text-3xl">Section 6: Energy–Symmetry Law (Why No Free Lunch in the Universe)</h2><h3 class="text-2xl">The Big Idea</h3><p>Whenever you compare two observers (say, someone on the ground and someone in orbit), <strong>the energy differences they see will always perfectly balance out.</strong> No matter how you swap perspectives — nobody ever gets “extra” energy for free.

Science is all about matching what we think to what we actually see in nature. A beautiful theory is useless if it does not align with what we observe. This section is devoted to grounding the abstract vision of WILL Geometry by demonstrating that it makes precise, testable predictions about real physical phenomena.</p><p>Let’s examine two key examples, which serve as rigorous empirical tests of the entire theoretical construction.</p><h3 class="text-2xl">1. Time Correction in the GPS System</h3><p>The Global Positioning System (GPS) is perhaps the ideal laboratory for testing relativistic effects in everyday life. For the system to function with high accuracy, GPS satellites must account for two relativistic effects that influence the rate of their onboard clocks compared to clocks on Earth:</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li><strong>Special Relativity (SR) effect:</strong> Satellites move at high speed (about 3.87 km/s), which causes their clocks to run slower than those on Earth. This effect is described by our kinetic projection beta.</li><li><strong>General Relativity (GR) effect:</strong> Satellites are at high altitude (about 20,200 km), where Earth's gravitational field is weaker. This causes their clocks to run faster than those on Earth. This effect is described by our potential projection kappa.</li></ul><p>The standard approach is to calculate these two corrections separately and sum them. WILL Geometry offers a more fundamental approach. It asserts that these two effects are not independent, but are linked by the unbreakable relation kappa2=2beta2 and can be combined into a single unified energetic parameter Q, where Q2=kappa2+beta2. Using this single parameter to calculate the overall relativistic time shift for the Earth–satellite system, WILL Geometry predicts that the clocks on GPS satellites should run ahead of ground-based clocks by about <strong>38 microseconds per day</strong>.</p><p>This result exactly matches the empirically measured value that must be continually added to the GPS system for it to function correctly. The success of this prediction is a powerful confirmation not only of the individual parts of the theory, but—more importantly—of the very principle of unification. It shows that treating kinetic and gravitational effects as unified geometric projections is not just a theoretical sophistication but a practical necessity for arriving at the correct answer.</p><h3 class="text-2xl">2. Precession of Mercury’s Orbit</h3><p>One of the earliest triumphs of Einstein’s general relativity was its explanation of the anomalous precession (slow rotation) of Mercury’s elliptical orbit. Observations showed that the perihelion (the point closest to the Sun) of Mercury’s orbit shifts by an additional 43 arcseconds per century, above what Newtonian gravity predicted.</p><p>WILL Geometry also faces this classic test. Using its fundamental equations and parameters (beta and kappa, calculated for Mercury in the gravitational field of the Sun), the theory allows us to compute the expected value of this relativistic precession. The result obtained within WILL Geometry matches both the GR prediction and the observed data with machine-level precision.</p><p>Detailed calculations for both examples are provided in <a href="https://antonrize.github.io/WILL/documents/WILL_PART_I_SR_GR.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this document</a>, but the narrative conclusion is clear: WILL Geometry is not merely a philosophical construction. It passes the most rigorous experimental and observational tests. It not only reproduces the successes of standard relativistic physics but does so from deeper, more unified first principles, lending its predictions extra weight and elegance. A theory born of pure logic finds its exact reflection in the workings of the real world. WILL Geometry stands up to every challenge that nature throws at it, not just matching standard physics, but explaining it from the ground up, using nothing but logic and geometry.</p></section>{% elsif include.part == 'section9' %}<section id="section-9"><h2 class="text-3xl">Section 9: A New Reality of Change — Dynamics Without Time</h2><p>Let’s get to the wildest part of WILL Geometry: <strong>What if time isn’t fundamental at all?</strong></p><h3 class="text-2xl">Rethinking Change and Time</h3><p>In “classic” physics, you always start with:</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li>A system’s current state,</li><li>Rules (equations) that tell you how it changes step by step as time flows by.</li></ul><p>Here, time is like a river: everything happens inside this flow.</p><p><strong>But in WILL Geometry, it’s the other way around:</strong></p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li>There’s no separate “river” of time.</li><li>There are just possible states — all the ways the universe could be, as long as they satisfy the balance equations.</li><li>Change is just moving from one balanced state to another.</li></ul><h3 class="text-2xl">So what is “dynamics” now?</h3><p>Instead of motion playing out in time, — you have a web of “allowed” states, all rigidly connected. — Any change in one parameter instantly forces all others to adjust, so the system stays in balance.</p><p>Imagine a black hole gaining mass:</p><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li>Its mass increases — but instantly, every other quantity (radius, curvature, energy density) also shifts, so the equations remain true.</li><li>No waiting, no flow — just a jump from one balanced setup to another.</li></ul><h3 class="text-2xl">What, then, is time?</h3><p><strong>Time is just our way of describing the difference between one balanced state and the next.</strong> It’s not some external clock ticking in the background — it’s a label for the sequence of changes.</p><blockquote>Time does not drive change — instead, change defines time.</blockquote><h3 class="text-2xl">Why does this matter?</h3><ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 my-4"><li>It flips our intuition: Physics isn’t about “how things change over time”, but about “which states are allowed, and how they follow each other in a logical sequence.”</li><li>This view might actually solve deep puzzles — like the “problem of time” in quantum gravity — where it’s unclear how to even define time in the first place.</li></ul><p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> In WILL Geometry, the universe is not a machine running inside time — it’s a perfectly balanced structure, forever reshaping itself.
