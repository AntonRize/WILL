## The Energy-Momentum Triangle
**Visualize energy, mass, and momentum as a simple right triangle:**

* **One side** (fixed) always represents the object's *rest energy* — this never changes, no matter how fast it moves.
* **The second side** grows as the object’s speed increases — this is its *momentum*.
* **The hypotenuse** is the *total energy* — it stretches as you go faster.

> When you slide the velocity, you can see how “momentum” grows, and total energy stretches to keep the triangle in perfect balance, but rest energy always stays the same.

**What’s the point?**

* The triangle shows that you can’t just add energies and momenta any way you like. They’re always connected by a simple geometric rule — just like the sides of any right triangle.
* No matter how fast you go, all three always fit together. The triangle is never broken.

$$
E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0 c^2)^2
$$

* $E$: Total energy
* $p$: Momentum
* $m_0 c^2$: Rest energy

**Simply saying:**

* **Rest energy** is your “starting stash” — it never goes away.
* **Momentum** is what you get when you start moving.
* **Total energy** is always the “longest side,” combining both.

**What This Means**

Special relativity stops being a bunch of rules about “strange time effects” or “postulates about light.”
Instead, it’s just a simple story of how all things must share a fixed “budget” of change between motion and time.
Mass, energy, and momentum are simply three perspectives on the same underlying geometric fact.

**Section 4: Act II – Gravity as a Shadow on the Sphere**

Having cracked motion using a simple circle, let’s tackle gravity.
Gravity is different: instead of working in one direction, like motion, it pulls equally from every side — like being surrounded in all directions.
So our “canvas” has to be not a line or circle, but a whole **sphere**.

**How Gravity is Just a Different Kind of Projection**

Imagine standing at the center of a big sphere — gravity “spreads out” the same in every direction from the mass at the center.

* To measure “how much” gravity there is, we use a new slider — let’s call it **kappa** (κ).
* κ tells us how close you are to the point where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape — the edge of a black hole.

**What does κ mean?**

* If κ = 0: no gravity at all.
* If κ = 1: you’re right at the “point of no return” — the event horizon.

You can think of κ as “how much of the universe’s speed limit you’d need to escape gravity right here.”
