## Energy–Symmetry Law (Why No Free Lunch in the Universe)
### The Big Idea

Whenever you compare two observers (say, someone on the ground and someone in orbit), **the energy differences they see will always perfectly balance out.**
No matter how you swap perspectives — nobody ever gets “extra” energy for free.
This is the universe’s built-in law of energetic fairness.

### How it works (without math)

Imagine:

* Observer **A** is standing on the ground.
* Observer **B** is orbiting above.

If an object moves from A (the ground) up to B (orbit):

* It has to *fight gravity* (gaining potential energy).
* It needs to *speed up* (gaining kinetic energy).

From B’s point of view, if the object comes *down*:

* It *drops* into stronger gravity (loses potential energy).
* It *slows down* to rest (loses kinetic energy).

**But if you add up both “energy stories,” the total change is always zero.**

> The universe never “creates” or “loses” energy when you swap perspectives — just moves it around.

$$
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0
$$

Each transfer includes both gravitational ($\kappa^2$) and kinetic ($\beta^2$) parts, always balancing out.

### The Magic of the “½” Factor

Why is there a “½” everywhere in the energy formulas?

* It’s the same reason why classical formulas have $½mv^2$ for kinetic energy or why gravity’s potential energy has a factor of ½ in the geometric model.
* The “½” keeps our geometric story in sync with the classical, familiar energy equations.

Potential energy: $U = -\frac{GMm}{r}$ maps to $-\frac{1}{2}\kappa^2$
Kinetic energy:  $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$   maps to $\frac{1}{2}\beta^2$

### Universal Speed Limit: Why Nothing Goes Faster than Light

This “energy symmetry” is so strict that it naturally sets the universe’s ultimate speed limit.

* If something *could* go faster than light, the balance would be broken — one observer would see “extra” energy appear out of nowhere.
* That’s not allowed: **causality and energy symmetry would both collapse.**
* So, the speed of light isn’t just a cosmic “speed trap” — it’s the built-in edge of energetic fairness.

<details>
<summary>Math explanation</summary>

If $\beta > 1$ (faster than light):  $\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} \neq 0$
So, must have $\beta \leq 1$ ($v \leq c$)

**In plain English:**

* The universe is like the world’s most perfect accountant:
   Every bit of energy spent or gained in one place is balanced by what’s lost or gained elsewhere.
* The speed of light is where this balance can just barely be maintained — go past it, and the rules snap.
