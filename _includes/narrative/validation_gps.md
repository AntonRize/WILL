## 1. Time Correction in the GPS System
The Global Positioning System (GPS) is perhaps the ideal laboratory for testing relativistic effects in everyday life. For the system to function with high accuracy, GPS satellites must account for two relativistic effects that influence the rate of their onboard clocks compared to clocks on Earth:

* **Special Relativity (SR) effect:** Satellites move at high speed (about 3.87 km/s), which causes their clocks to run slower than those on Earth. This effect is described by our kinetic projection β.
* **General Relativity (GR) effect:** Satellites are at high altitude (about 20,200 km), where Earth's gravitational field is weaker. This causes their clocks to run faster than those on Earth. This effect is described by our potential projection κ.

The standard approach is to calculate these two corrections separately and sum them. WILL Geometry offers a more fundamental approach. It asserts that these two effects are not independent, but are linked by the unbreakable relation κ² = 2β² and can be combined into a single unified energetic parameter Q, where Q² = κ² + β². Using this single parameter to calculate the overall relativistic time shift for the Earth–satellite system, WILL Geometry predicts that the clocks on GPS satellites should run ahead of ground-based clocks by about

**38 microseconds per day**.

This result exactly matches the empirically measured value that must be continually added to the GPS system for it to function correctly. The success of this prediction is a powerful confirmation not only of the individual parts of the theory, but—more importantly—of the very principle of unification. It shows that treating kinetic and gravitational effects as unified geometric projections is not just a theoretical sophistication but a practical necessity for arriving at the correct answer.
