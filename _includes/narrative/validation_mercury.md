## 2. Precession of Mercury’s Orbit
One of the earliest triumphs of Einstein’s general relativity was its explanation of the anomalous precession (slow rotation) of Mercury’s elliptical orbit. Observations showed that the perihelion (the point closest to the Sun) of Mercury’s orbit shifts by an additional 43 arcseconds per century, above what Newtonian gravity predicted.

WILL Geometry also faces this classic test. Using its fundamental equations and parameters (β and κ, calculated for Mercury in the gravitational field of the Sun), the theory allows us to compute the expected value of this relativistic precession. The result obtained within WILL Geometry matches both the GR prediction and the observed data with machine-level precision.

Detailed calculations for both examples are provided in https://antonrize.github.io/WILL/documents/WILL_PART_I_SR_GR.pdf, but the narrative conclusion is clear: WILL Geometry is not merely a philosophical construction. It passes the most rigorous experimental and observational tests. It not only reproduces the successes of standard relativistic physics but does so from deeper, more unified first principles, lending its predictions extra weight and elegance. A theory born of pure logic finds its exact reflection in the workings of the real world. WILL Geometry stands up to every challenge that nature throws at it, not just matching standard physics, but explaining it from the ground up, using nothing but logic and geometry.
