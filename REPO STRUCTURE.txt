# WILL Geometry Repository Structure: Full Overview  (estimated)

## 1. **Repository Structure (Folders & Files)**

**Root:**

* `.github/`, `.gitignore`, `.nojekyll`, `Gemfile`, `README.md`, etc.
* The root contains your standard Jekyll/GitHub Pages scaffolding and configuration.

**Key Directories:**

* `WILL DATABASE/`, `SPARC DATA/`, `Colab Notebooks/`

  * Contain datasets, reference notebooks, raw and processed empirical data.
  * Mostly not used directly in web builds but as research artifacts.

* `_data/`

  * YAML or CSV data for site configuration or dynamic content.
  * Not heavily used for interactive/narrative content.

* `_includes/`

  * **Critical for content composition in Jekyll.**
  * Contains:

   
* `_layouts/`

  * Contains HTML templates:

    * `default.html` (main site wrapper, includes navbar, loads Chart.js, pulls in content)
    * Any special layouts (e.g., for calculators, geometry page, etc.)

* `_posts/`

  * For Jekyll blog posts or news; sometimes used for long-form “papers.”

* `admin/`, `assistant/`, `discussions/`, `documents/`

  * Each used for different aspects of the project (content management, AI assistant code, discussion documents, etc.)

**Page Files:**


## 2. **File Interdependencies & Composition**

* **Jekyll** is the static site generator.

  * Uses `_config.yml` for navigation, settings, and plugin config.
  * All Markdown/HTML pages are rendered through layouts and includes.

* **Interactive Elements:**

  * **Chart.js** loaded globally in the layout (no double-import).
  * All initialization (`new Chart(...)`) is in `interactive.md`.
  * Each chart (e.g., “energy-momentum triangle,” “Q-circle,” “gravity plot”) gets a `<canvas id="...">` in the page, **not** in the narrative.
  * **Sliders** and other UI elements also live in `interactive.md`, not in narrative.

* **Spoilers & Collapsible Blocks:**

  * Two types:

    * `<div class="spoiler">...</div>` for math sections hidden by default.
    * `<details><summary>...</summary>...</details>` for general collapsibles.
  * Both are considered narrative, NOT interactive code.

* **Desmos Infoboxes:**

  * Plain HTML “infoboxes” with a placeholder for a Desmos link.
  * Placed near GPS and Mercury validation sections in the narrative, but rendered via interactive.md.

## 3. **Build Logic & Assembly**

* Jekyll reads all pages, applies layouts, resolves `{% include ... %}` directives.
* Narrative is inserted wherever needed, interactive code lives only in designated files.
* If an `{% include ... %}` references a missing file, Jekyll **fails the build** with a clear error.
* No symlinks are allowed in safe mode (GH Pages).

---

## 4. **Physical & Epistemological Intent**

* The project is a **theoretical physics exploration** aimed at unifying relativity and quantum mechanics (“WILL Geometry”).
* **Narrative** explains the physical context, postulates, and step-by-step derivations in accessible form.
* **Interactive elements** (charts, sliders, infoboxes) let users explore geometric and physical relationships in real time.
* **Spoilers/collapsibles** make the page approachable, hiding heavy math by default for a wider audience.
* **Desmos links** let users check calculations empirically outside the site.

---

## 5. **Recent Refactors & Best Practices**

* Migration from many small `_includes/narrative/*.md` files to a single `_includes/narrative.md` with Liquid guards (to simplify editing).
* Interactive code now **never resides** in narrative includes.
* All Chart.js usage is made browser-safe (no global variable pollution).
* Clean, modular insertion of info blocks, narrative, and interactive widgets.

---

## 6. **Common Failure Modes**

* Build errors if `{% include ... %}` references a missing or renamed file.
* Errors if interactive code slips into narrative.md (breaks reusability and layout).
* Layout/design bugs if Chart.js or canvas elements are duplicated/misplaced.

---

## 7. **How Everything Fits Together**

* **Jekyll’s pipeline** pulls narrative chunks into interactive.md at precise locations, allowing alternating narrative and interactivity.
* Layout files ensure Chart.js is loaded **before** any charts initialize.
* All critical narrative content is always available for refactor, export, or re-inclusion elsewhere.

## 8. **Summary Table**

| File/Folder                 | Purpose                                 | Rules                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `_includes/narrative.md`    | All main narrative/text, math, spoilers | No interactive code/scripts/canvas    |
| `interactive.md`            | Page for all interactivity              | All JS, canvas, chart logic here      |
| `_layouts/default.html`     | Page wrapper, nav, Chart.js load        | Only layout/boilerplate code          |
| `_config.yml`               | Navigation, site config                 | Must match actual file structure      |
| `_includes/` (legacy \*.md) | Used for modular includes               | Only if not using single narrative.md |
| Data & research folders     | Raw/reference data, not rendered        | Only for backend/research             |

---

**In summary:**
The structure is designed for modular, maintainable, and error-free Jekyll builds, with a strict separation of narrative and interactive code, maximum clarity, and easy debugging.
Your philosophy of “no hidden code in narrative, no missing includes, all math is opt-in” is at the heart of the system.
