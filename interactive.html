            Now that the rules of the game have been established, let’s consider the simplest case: one‑dimensional motion.
            According to our logic, this process must be described on the only possible closed and symmetric 1D geometry—the circle.
            This act of our narrative is devoted to reconstructing special relativity (SR) using nothing but these geometric tools.

            Imagine all possible states of movement as points around a perfect circle.
            The <em>radius</em> of this circle is the fastest possible speed in the universe — the universal “speed of change.”
            Every moving object is like a pointer from the center of the circle to some spot on its edge.
            <!-- added --> For clarity, we set <em>c = 1</em>; the total “speed of evolution” is a vector that can be decomposed into horizontal (space) and vertical (time) components. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

        <ul class="narrative-text list-disc list-inside">
            <li><strong>Movement:</strong> How fast something moves through space is just “how much” of that pointer is aimed sideways around the circle. The faster it goes, the more it “leans” into space, and the less is left “pointing” upward — toward time.</li>
            <li><strong>Time:</strong> How fast time ticks for something is just “how much” of that pointer is aimed along the time direction. If the object speeds up through space, less of the pointer is left for time — so its time slows down.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="narrative-text">
            Think of it like sharing a fixed budget: If you spend more of your “change” moving through space, you have less left for moving through time.

            Here’s the coolest part: That famous equation, E = mc², isn’t some magic law — it’s just what you get when you realize energy and mass are two sides of the same coin. At rest, all of an object’s energy points along the time direction. When it moves, some energy “tilts” into space — but the total stays balanced, so that the piece along time remains constant. Mass is just a way to relate an object’s energy at rest to its fundamental “speed of change.” Energy increases as the object moves, simply to keep the system in balance.

            Having cracked motion using a simple circle, let’s tackle gravity. Gravity is different: instead of working in one direction, like motion, it pulls equally from every side — like being surrounded in all directions. So our “canvas” has to be not a line or circle, but a whole <strong>sphere</strong>.
        </p>

        <p class="narrative-text">
            Imagine standing at the center of a big sphere — gravity “spreads out” the same in every direction from the mass at the center. To measure “how much” gravity there is, we use a new slider — let’s call it <strong>kappa</strong> (κ). It tells us how close you are to the point where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape — the edge of a black hole.

        <ul class="narrative-text list-disc list-inside">

            <p class="narrative-text">
                This “energy symmetry” is so strict that it naturally sets the universe’s ultimate speed limit. If something <em>could</em> go faster than light, the balance would be broken — one observer would see “extra” energy appear out of nowhere. That’s not allowed: <strong>causality and energy symmetry would both collapse.</strong> So, the speed of light isn’t just a cosmic “speed trap” — it’s the built‑in edge of energetic fairness.

            After all the geometric juggling, here’s the punchline: Everything — gravity, motion, energy, even the rules for black holes — can be summed up in just one line. It states that the universe always keeps you within the same “safe fraction” of the maximum possible energy density, preventing the singularities of General Relativity.

            Let’s get to the wildest part of WILL Geometry: <strong>What if time isn’t fundamental at all?</strong> In “classic” physics, time is like a river: everything <em>happens inside</em> this flow. But in WILL Geometry, it’s the other way around: There’s no separate “river” of time. There are just possible states — all the ways the universe could be, as long as they satisfy the balance equations. <em>Change</em> is just moving from one balanced state to another. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

            Bottom line: In WILL Geometry the universe is not a machine running inside time — it’s a perfectly balanced structure, forever reshaping itself. What we call “time” is simply our narrative for that ongoing process of rebalancing. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

            We started with one simple idea: <strong>Spacetime is just energy in motion.</strong> From this, logic alone led us to circles and spheres as the natural “shapes” of the universe, relativity as a projection on these shapes, and the deep unification of motion and gravity. This journey uncovered a hidden unity behind the laws of physics, replacing arbitrary rules with pure geometry and energy flow. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
