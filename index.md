# WILL Geometry Research

**Investigation of the fundamental nature of space, time and energy through unified geometric structure**

---

## Fundamental Postulate

$\boxed{\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION}}$

From this single postulate, without free parameters, we derive:

## Key Results

### ✅ Special Relativity
- Geometric derivation of relativistic factor $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}$
- Projectional derivation of $E = mc^2$
- Explanation of speed of light limit

### ✅ General Relativity
- Complete equivalence with Einstein's equations
- Resolution of singularity problem
- Natural boundaries $\kappa^2 \leq 1$

### ✅ Quantum Mechanics without quantum magic
- Geometric quantization: $n\lambda = 2\pi r$
- **Independent derivation of fine structure constant: $\alpha = \beta$**
- Hydrogen spectral lines without wave functions

### ✅ Cosmology
- Derivation of cosmological parameters $\Omega_\Lambda = \frac{2}{3}$, $\Omega_m = \frac{1}{3}$
- Geometric explanation of dark energy
- Equation of state $w = -1$ from symmetry

## Fundamental Geometry

All physical phenomena emerge from projections on the unit circle:

- **$\beta = \cos(\theta_S)$** — kinetic projection (spatial)
- **$\kappa = \sin(\theta_G)$** — gravitational projection (temporal)
- **$\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$** — universal geometric relation

## Research Structure

### [Part I: Relativistic Foundations](/documents/WILL_PART_I_SR_GR.pdf)
From postulate to SR and GR through projection geometry

### [Part II: Cosmology](/parts/cosmology)
Two-parameter cosmology without Friedmann equations

### [Part III: Quantum Mechanics](/parts/quantum)
Atomic structure as geometric quantization

### [Part IV: α = β](/parts/alpha-beta)
**Revolutionary result:** fine structure constant is not a constant

## About the Project

This is a living research project, started from pure curiosity by a self-taught individual without formal education.

**Motivation:** To understand the fundamental nature of reality through epistemological purity and geometric simplicity.

**Status:** All results are open, verifiable, and await criticism from the scientific community.
