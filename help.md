\# Help This Research



If you believe fundamental physics should be open, transparent, and built from first principles — you can help make it happen.

\## The Problem



In our market‑driven society, there are essentially no programs that support independent researchers in fields with extremely long payoff horizons — like fundamental physics. Even within academia, long‑horizon foundational work is often viewed as a risky career move.



The result is structural underfunding of the very projects that aim to clarify the foundations of reality — projects that rarely fit short‑cycle grant logic.



\## My Path



Everything on this website — tools, simulations, visualizations, documentation — has been created by me personally with very limited resources. The work is released openly so anyone can test, critique, and build upon it.



There is no institutional funding behind this; it is driven by first‑principles reasoning and the conviction that fundamental physics should be transparent and accessible.



\## What your support enables



\- Focused research time without unrelated side jobs.

\- Compute for large‑scale data processing \& cosmological simulations.

\- Software, hosting, and tooling for open publications.

\- Interactive tools so anyone can independently verify results.



\## Why this matters



\- A deeper understanding of the universe and our place in it.

\- Preserving the tradition of open, verifiable science.

\- Empowering independent researchers outside institutional constraints.

\- \[See current results \& predictions](/WILL/results/)
