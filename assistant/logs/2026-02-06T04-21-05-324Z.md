**User:** Hi! What WILL documents you have access to?

**Assistant:** I have access to the following WILL documents:

*   **WILL Part I: Relational Geometry**
    This document introduces the foundational framework of Relational Geometry, based on the principle SPACETIME $\equiv$ ENERGY. It derives special and general relativity, including Lorentz factors, the energy-momentum relation, Schwarzschild and Einstein field equations, from fundamental geometric constraints without metrics, tensors, or free parameters. It addresses long-standing problems such as GR singularities, local energy ambiguity, and the equivalence of gravitational and inertial masses.

*   **WILL Part II: Resolution of the Cosmological Dark Sector**
    This paper applies WILL Relational Geometry to cosmology and galactic dynamics. It derives the Hubble parameter ($H_0$), reproduces distant supernova flux levels, reconstructs the CMB acoustic spectrum (resolving the "Low Quadrupole" anomaly without dark components), and predicts galactic rotation curves, the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR), and wide binary star dynamics. It argues that "Dark" phenomenology is superseded by this relational geometric ontology.

*   **WILL Part III: QM (Quantum Mechanics)**
    This document extends WILL Relational Geometry to the quantum realm. It derives the complete structure of the hydrogen atom, including the Bohr radius, quantized energy levels, and the fine-structure constant ($\alpha$), as consequences of geometric and topological closure. It provides a geometric origin for the de Broglie relation, spin, the Pauli Exclusion Principle, and the Uncertainty Principle, reframing quantum phenomena without classical force analogues or probabilistic wavefunctions.
