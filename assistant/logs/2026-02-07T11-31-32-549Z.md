**User:** "How can you calculate the Schwarzschild radius without Mass or G? That's physically impossible."

**Assistant:** The WILL Relational Geometry (RG) framework explicitly addresses this claim by re-conceptualizing the Schwarzschild radius ($R_s$), mass ($m_0$), and the gravitational constant ($G$). In WILL RG, $R_s$ is not an output of $m_0$ and $G$; rather, $m_0$ and $G$ are considered "output calibration tools" used to translate a geometrically derived $R_s$ into conventional units (doc. Part I - Constants as Converters).

Here's how WILL RG claims to calculate the Schwarzschild radius without direct reliance on mass or $G$ as inputs:

1.  **Fundamental Principle: SPACETIME $\equiv$ ENERGY**: The framework starts from the ontological principle that spacetime and energy are equivalent (doc. Part I - Ontological Principle: Removing the Hidden Assumption). All physically meaningful quantities are relational features of this unified entity.

2.  **Relational Projections as Observables**: Instead of mass, the theory uses dimensionless relational projections, $\kappa$ (gravitational potential intensity) and $\beta$ (kinematic intensity), which are directly measurable from light interactions:
    *   $\kappa$ is related to gravitational redshift ($z_g$).
    *   $\beta$ is related to Doppler shift ($z_D$) and orbital velocity.
    *   The "Relational Spacetime Factor," $\tau_W$, which is the inverse of the total measured redshift product ($1/(1+z_{tot})$), encapsulates the combined phase interactions of light (doc. Part I - Operational Measurability of Relational Projections). These are dimensionless and directly observable.

3.  **$R_s$ as a System Scale Derived from Geometric Gradients**: $R_s$ is understood as a geometric scale factor of a system, not a consequence of its mass. It emerges from the conservation of a relational invariant, $W = \frac{1}{2}(\kappa^2 - \beta^2)$, which holds true throughout a closed orbital system (doc. Part I - Algebraic Determination of System Scale).

4.  **Three Algebraic Methods for Calculating $R_s$**: The framework provides algebraically exact formulas for $R_s$ using only observable geometric distances ($r$, $a$) and the dimensionless relational projections ($\beta$, $\tau_W$):

    *   **Two-Point Method**: Given measurements of geometric position ($r$) and kinematic intensity ($\beta$) at two arbitrary points along a trajectory ($r_1, r_2, \beta_1, \beta_2$), the Schwarzschild radius can be calculated as:
        $$R_s = \frac{r_1 r_2}{r_2 - r_1}(\beta_1^2 - \beta_2^2)$$
        (doc. Part I - Two-Point Schwarzschild Scale). This method extracts $R_s$ purely from geometric gradients.

    *   **Balance Point Method**: If the orbital geometry (semi-major axis $a$) is known, and the total light signal ($\tau_W$) is measured at the balance point of the orbit ($r=a$), $R_s$ is given by:
        $$R_s = \frac{a}{2}\left(3 - \sqrt{1 + 8\tau_W^2(O_o)}\right)$$
        (doc. Part I - Balance Point Formula).

    *   **Arbitrary Phase Method**: More generally, for any single epoch observation at an arbitrary radius $r_o$ and known orbital geometry ($a$), $R_s$ can be calculated from the single light observable $\tau_{Wo}$:
        $$R_s = \frac{r_o}{2(2a-r_o)}\left(4a - r_o - \sqrt{(4a-r_o)^2 - 8a(2a-r_o)(1-\tau_{Wo}^2)}\right)$$
        (doc. Part I - Arbitrary Phase Formula).

5.  **$G$ and $m_0$ as Conversion Factors**: Once $R_s$ is determined using these geometric and kinematic observables, one can derive the "mass" $m_0$ using the conventional definition $m_0 \equiv \frac{R_s c^2}{2G}$ if one wishes to express the result in kilograms. In this context, $G$ serves as a unit conversion constant, translating the geometric scale $R_s$ into the conventional concept of mass (doc. Part I - The Role of G as Translation Constant).

In summary, the WILL RG framework claims to calculate $R_s$ directly from the geometry of observable light interactions and distances, rather than from inferred mass and the gravitational constant. This re-positions $m_0$ and $G$ as derived quantities or calibration tools within the system.
