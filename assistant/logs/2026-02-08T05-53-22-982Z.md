**User:** So what is this website all about?

**Assistant:** This website is dedicated to the exploration and dissemination of **WILL Relational Geometry (RG)**, a unified theory of physics that posits a fundamental ontological identity:

$$\boxed{\textbf{SPACETIME} \;\equiv\; \textbf{ENERGY}}$$

This is not presented as a new postulate, but as a direct consequence of removing a hidden assumption prevalent in modern physics: the artificial separation of "structure" (spacetime) and "dynamics" (energy) (doc. Part I - Ontological Blind Spot In Modern Physics, False Separation).

The core idea is that this single act of methodological hygiene is sufficient to derive all of physics logically and geometrically, without introducing new axioms, metrics, tensors, or free parameters (doc. Part I - Abstract, Foundational Principles). Instead of describing phenomena, WILL RG aims to *generate* them as necessary consequences of its internal logic and geometric constraints (doc. Part I - Generative Physics).

Key aspects of WILL Relational Geometry include:

*   **Relational Nature:** All physical quantities are defined by their relations, not absolute properties. Energy is the relational measure of difference between possible states (doc. Part I - What is Energy in Relational Framework?).
*   **Geometric Carriers:** The theory derives that all interactions are mediated by minimal, maximally symmetric relational carriers: the $S^1$ (for directional/kinematic transformations) and $S^2$ (for omnidirectional/gravitational transformations) (doc. Part I - Derivation of the Relational Carriers).
*   **Projections $\beta$ and $\kappa$:** Observable phenomena, such as relativistic and gravitational effects, emerge as "projections" ($\beta$ for kinematic, $\kappa$ for potential) on these carriers, bound by fundamental conservation laws (e. Part I - The Amplitude-Phase Duality, Clear Relational Symmetry Between Kinematic and Potential Projections).
*   **Singularity-Free Physics:** The framework naturally resolves singularities in General Relativity by imposing geometric bounds on energy density (doc. Part I - No Singularities, No Hidden Regions).
*   **Unification:** It offers a unified derivation of Special and General Relativity, explaining phenomena like Mercury's precession and gravitational lensing from simpler algebraic principles (doc. Part I - Deriving the WILL Structure, Unified Relational Geometry: Gravity versus Electromagnetism).
*   **Generative Physics:** It moves from a descriptive approach to a generative one, where physical laws are not assumed but emerge as necessary consequences of relational geometry (doc. Part I - Ontological Shift: From Descriptive to Generative Physics).

The website serves as an interactive platform to explore these derivations, demonstrate empirical validations, and provide tools for users to test the theory themselves. You can find more details about its foundations on the [LOGOS MAP](https://willrg.com/LOGOS_MAP/) and interactive proofs on [Relativistic Foundations](https://willrg.com/relativistic-foundations/), [Relational Orbital Mechanics](https://willrg.com/ROM/), and [Galactic Dynamics](https://willrg.com/galactic-dynamics/).
