**User:** There's no jumping to conclusion I read your documents you dont have anything relating to a reference frame. That requires geometry. How else do you describe kinematic motion relative to an observer or to multiple observers.

How do you relate the angles of one observer motion relative to another. Try for example an emitter in transverse motion to the observer. Unless Im mistaken every single equation you have outputs a scalar value. You don't have any vector addition rules with regards to distance and angle of travel. Relativity involves more than just scalar ratios.

So tell me without any geometry how do you apply a Galilean or even a Lorentz transformation between multiple events ?

You and I also have difference of opinion of a conserved system. Freefall is a conserved state. There is no external influence such as force acting upon the object in motion. Yet planetary orbits is not a conserved system you have change in direction aka acceleration. In GR this requires the transformation matrix.

You dont have one so how do you translate the freefall state to one of acceleration and stay conserved ? A boost ( change in velocity under the Minkowskii metric is just a type of rotation ).

How do you relate an observer measuring kinematic motion of that orbiting body without geometry to equate an angle of view ?

Aside from the statement closure whats your mathematical proof of closure ?

You describe orthogonal projections but in the same breath state there is no geometry yet an orthogonal projection is 90 degrees relative to the axis its projecting from classical example x axis is orthogonal to the y axis.

I dont care if your manifolds involve spacetime. Thats not a requirement of a manifold it doesn't even require spatial coordinates if a manifold only requires one parameter to uniquely identify each point that's a 1 d manifold. If the manifold requires 2 or more parameters to uniquely identify each point. The number of parameter required is the dimensionality of that manifold. It doesn't require any coordinate basis the number of required parameters or dimension is the number of effective degrees of freedom.

With regards to boosts in Lorentz for the benefit of other readers here's a listing

\section{Lorentz Group}

Lorentz transformations list spherical coordinates (rotation along the z axis through an angle $\theta$)

\begin{equation}
(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (ct, r, \theta, \phi)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (-ct, r, r^2, \theta, [r^2\sin^2\theta]\phi)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
x' = x\cos\theta + y\sin\theta, \quad y' = -x\sin\theta + y\cos\theta
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\Lambda^{\mu}_{\nu} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \cos\theta & \sin\theta & 0 \\
0 & \sin\theta & \cos\theta & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Generator along z axis}
\begin{equation}
k_z = \frac{1}{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial\phi}\bigg|_{\phi=0}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Generator of boost along x axis}
\begin{equation}
k_x = \frac{1}{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial\phi}\bigg|_{\phi=0} = -i\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Boost along y axis}
\begin{equation}
k_y = -i\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Generator of boost along z direction}
\begin{equation}
k_z = -i\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The above is the generator of boosts below is the generator of rotations.

\begin{equation}
J_z = \frac{1}{i}\frac{\partial\Lambda}{\partial\theta}\bigg|_{\theta=0}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
J_x = -i\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
J_y = -i\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
J_z = -i\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

They obey commutations

\begin{equation}
[A,B] = AB - BA
\end{equation}

Does your work do anything to replace the above?

The above applies for the Minkowski metric essentially SR.

**Assistant:** Your request is very complex and the AI took too long to think. You can try asking the same question again or try simplifying it a little or even better - you can ask Anton Rize freewillrg@gmail.com. Sometimes a good question is better than any answer...
