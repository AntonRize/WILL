**User:** I don't see earth's rotation on your gps estimation. Why?

**Assistant:** In the WILL Relational Geometry framework, the Earth's rotation is accounted for implicitly within the kinematic projection $\beta$ (and its orthogonal component $\beta_Y$), which forms part of the unified relational spacetime factor $\tau$. The framework states:

1.  **Unified Relational Scaling:** Both kinematic ($S^1$) and gravitational ($S^2$) transformations act as independent projections of the same invariant energy. These are combined into a total local energy scale:
    $$E_{\mathrm{loc}} = \frac{E_0}{\tau} = \frac{E_0}{\beta_Y\,\kappa_X}$$
    This means the "GPS time shift" is derived from a "single symmetric law" where $\tau$ is the product of the kinematic phase factor ($\beta_Y$) and the gravitational phase factor ($\kappa_X$). (doc. Part I - Theorem: Equivalence of Inertial and Gravitational Response).

2.  **Kinematic Projection ($\beta$):** The kinematic projection $\beta$ is defined as $v/c$, representing "how much of the universal 'speed of change' you see as motion through space, relative to yourself" (doc. Part I - Section: Energy as a Relation - What $\kappa$ and $\beta$ Actually Mean). The rotation of the Earth (or a satellite in orbit around it) involves a velocity, which directly contributes to this $\beta$ term.

3.  **GPS Estimation:** The document explicitly states that the framework reproduces the "GPS time shift / gravitational redshift" and lists the value of 38.52 $\mu$s/day as verified (doc. Part I - Table: Classical GR results vs. WILL RG outcomes). This combined shift accounts for both the gravitational potential of Earth (influencing $\kappa_X$) and the relative kinematic motion of the satellites and observers (influencing $\beta_Y$).

Therefore, while "Earth's rotation" is not listed as a separate line item or an explicit term in the formula for $\tau$, its kinematic effects are naturally subsumed within the calculation of the $\beta$ (and $\beta_Y$) factor for any system in motion relative to the observer's frame. The framework's core principle is to unify these effects into a single, composite relational measure, rather than treating them as separate classical corrections.
