\begin{abstract}
In conventional cosmology, the Friedmann equations describe the evolution of the universe by solving differential equations involving the scale factor \(a(t)\), energy densities, curvature \(k\), and a time-dependent metric.
\[
\boxed{\textbf{In Will Geometry, no metric is required.}}
\]
All cosmological quantities follow directly from a single scale parameter and geometric energy projection parameters: \( \kappa \), \( \beta \)
\end{abstract}

\section{Scale-Invariant Energy Geometry}

The Will Geometry framework from Part I establishes a fundamental principle: all physical phenomena emerge from the same algebraic structure of dimensionless energy projections, regardless of scale.

\subsection{Fundamental Parameters}

\begin{align}
\textbf{Kinematic projection}\\ \quad \beta &= \frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{2r_{d}}} = \sqrt{\frac{Gm_0}{r_{d}c^2}} = \cos(\theta_1) \quad \text{(Orbital velocity)} \\
\textbf{Potential projection}\\ \quad \kappa &= \frac{v_e}{c} = \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{r_{d}}} = \sqrt{\frac{2Gm_0}{r_{d}c^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\rho}{\rho_{max}}} = \sin(\theta_2) \quad \text{(Escape velocity)}
\end{align}

\subsection{Core Geometric Relation}

\begin{equation}
\boxed{\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2}
\end{equation}

This fundamental ratio emerges from the geometry of energy projection: the ratio of the total angular measures ($4\pi/2\pi = 2$) in energetically closed systems.

\subsection{Scale Invariance}

These dimensionless parameters apply universally by substituting only the central mass $m_0$:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Atomic:} $m_0 = m_{proton}$
\item \textbf{Stellar:} $m_0 = M_{sun}$  
\item \textbf{Cosmological:} $m_0 = M_{universe}$
\end{itemize}

The algebraic relationships remain identical across all scales.


\section{Eliminating the Friedmann Equations: Will Geometry Requires Only Two  Parameters}

In conventional cosmology, the Friedmann equations describe the evolution of the universe by solving differential equations involving the scale factor \(a(t)\), energy densities, curvature \(k\), and a time-dependent metric.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Key Insight]
\textbf{In Will Geometry, no metric is required.}
All cosmological quantities follow directly from a single scale parameter and geometric energy projection parameter: \( \kappa \).
\end{tcolorbox}

No postulated spacetime manifold.  
No evolving scale factor.  
No tensor fields.  
No metric signatures.

\begin{equation}
\boxed{
\text{Cosmology emerges from geometry of energy projection — not from geometry of space.}
}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Deriving the Cosmological Relation $\kappa^2 = \Omega$}

In this section, we derive the relationship between the geometric energy parameter $\kappa$ and the ratio of the actual energy density of the Universe $\rho$ to the critical density $\rho_{max}$. This leads to the expression $\kappa^2 = \Omega$, where $\Omega$ is the dimensionless density parameter commonly used in cosmology.

We begin by considering the general formula for $\kappa$, derived from energy geometry:

\begin{equation}
\kappa = \sqrt{\frac{2 G M_U}{r_H c^2}}
\end{equation}

Here, $M_U$ is the total mass-energy content within the observable Universe, and $r_H$ is the Hubble radius, defined as:

\begin{equation}
r_H = \frac{c}{H_0}
\end{equation}

To express $M_U$ in terms of the average energy density $\rho_0$, we use the standard formula for the mass within a sphere of radius $r_H$:

\begin{equation}
M_U = 4 \pi r_H^3 \rho
\end{equation}

Substituting into the expression for $\kappa$ gives:

\begin{align}
\kappa &= \sqrt{\frac{2 G}{r_H c^2} \cdot \left( 4 \pi r_H^3 \rho \right)} \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{8 \pi G}{ c^2} \cdot r_H^2 \cdot \rho}
\end{align}

We now insert the definition of the critical density $\rho_c$:

\begin{equation}
\rho_{max} = \frac{H_0^2}{8 \pi G}
\end{equation}

We also recall that $r_H = \frac{c}{H_0}$, so $r_H^2 = \frac{c^2}{H_0^2}$.

Substituting into the previous expression:

\begin{align}
\kappa &= \sqrt{ \frac{8 \pi G}{ c^2} \cdot \frac{c^2}{H_0^2} \cdot \rho } 
= \sqrt{ \frac{8 \pi G}{ H_0^2} \cdot \rho }
\end{align}

Now we invert and substitute the expression for $\rho_{max}$:

\begin{align}
\kappa &= \sqrt{ \frac{\rho}{\rho_{max}} } \,
\Rightarrow \quad \kappa^2 = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{max}}
\end{align}

Finally, recalling that the ratio $\rho / \rho_{max}$ is by definition the cosmological density parameter $\Omega$, we obtain:

\begin{equation}
\boxed{ \kappa^2 = \Omega }
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Clarification on Interpretation}

Although $\Omega = \rho / \rho_{\text{max}}$ is traditionally associated with the spatial flatness of the Universe in the standard cosmological model, the relation $\kappa^2 = \rho / \rho_{\text{max}}$ in the Will Geometry framework does not imply flatness in the metric sense. Instead, it quantifies the degree of energy projection relative to the critical geometric configuration. The concept of "flatness" as used in metric-based cosmology has no direct analog in the non-metric structure of Energy Geometry.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!75!black,title=This relation establishes=\bfseries]
Direct connection between the geometric energy parameter $\kappa$ and the large-scale energy content of the Universe.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Emergence of the Hubble Parameter from Energy Geometry}

In Will Geometry, the Hubble parameter arises not from spacetime expansion, but from a scale-invariant relation between geometric projection parameters. The definition of the characteristic distance and time scale:

\[
r_{d} = \frac{c}{H}, \qquad t_{d} = \frac{1}{H}
\]

leads directly to the expression:

\begin{equation}
\boxed{
H = \frac{c}{r_{\text{d}}} = \frac{1}{t_{\text{d}}}
}
\end{equation}

This expression holds across all scales and energy densities in the model, since both \( r_{d} \) and \( t_{d} \) are defined through the projection parameter \( \kappa \), independently of the specific value of \( H \).

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!75!black,title=Interpretation]
In this framework, the Hubble constant is not a free cosmological parameter — it is a derived geometric ratio between the universal speed of projection \( c \), the characteristic radius of energy distribution \( r_{d} \), and the corresponding projection time \( t_{d} \).
\end{tcolorbox}


\section{Geometric Closure between \(\Lambda,\,H,\,\kappa\) and the Causal Disconnection Scale}

From the Will Geometry prescription the cosmological term is a pure
curvature residue
\[
\boxed{\;\Lambda=\frac{\kappa^{2}}{r_{d}^{2}}\;} .
\tag{1}
\]

\vspace{.5em}
\noindent
The escape–curvature parameter \(\kappa\) is itself related to the
Schwarzschild scale,
\[
\kappa^{2}
=\frac{R_{s}}{r_{d}}
\;\;\Longrightarrow\;\;
R_{s}=\kappa^{2}r_{d} .
\tag{2}
\]

\paragraph{Hubble frequency.}
Using \eqref{2} the Will Geometry Hubble parameter
\[
H=\frac{\kappa^{2}c}{R_{s}}
\tag{3}
\]
reduces identically to the simple inverse‐radius law
\[
\boxed{\,H=\frac{c}{r_{d}}\,}.
\tag{4}
\]
Hence
\(
t_{d}\equiv r_{d}/c = 1/H
\)
as required.

\paragraph{Linking \(\Lambda\) to \(H\).}
Insert \(r_{d}=c/H\) from \eqref{4} into \eqref{1}:
\[
\Lambda
=\frac{\kappa^{2}}{(c/H)^{2}}
=\boxed{\;
\frac{\kappa^{2}H^{2}}{c^{2}}
\;} .
\tag{5}
\]
Equation \eqref{5} is the exact geometric counterpart of the usual
\(\Lambda\text{CDM}\) relation \(\Lambda=3\Omega_\Lambda H^{2}/c^{2}\), with the
identification
\[
\boxed{\;\Omega_\Lambda=\kappa^{2}\;} .
\]

\paragraph{Density form.}
Define the maximal geometric density
\(
\rho_{\max}=c^{2}/(8\pi G\,r_{d}^{2})
\).
Using \eqref{4},
\[
\rho_{\max}=\frac{H^{2}}{8\pi G}\;.
\]
With \(\rho_\Lambda=\Lambda c^{2}/(8\pi G)\) and \eqref{5} we obtain the
closed chain
\[
\rho_\Lambda
=\frac{\kappa^{2}H^{2}}{8\pi G}
=\kappa^{2}\rho_{\max},
\qquad
\Omega_\Lambda=\frac{\rho_\Lambda}{\rho_{\max}}
=\kappa^{2}.
\tag{6}
\]
If \(\kappa^{2}=2/3\) (as demanded by the projection balance $\kappa^{2}+\beta^2=1$ \quad and \quad $\kappa^{2}=2\beta^{2}$),
equations \eqref{5}–\eqref{6} reproduce the observed
\(\Omega_\Lambda\approx0.67\) to within current Planck–level accuracy.

\paragraph{Compact summary.}
All late-time “dark-energy” relations emerge from a single algebraic
identity once the radial scale \(r_{d}\) is specified:
\[
\boxed{\Lambda r_{d}^{2}=\kappa^{2}}
\;\Longleftrightarrow\;
\boxed{\Lambda=\frac{\kappa^{2}H^{2}}{c^{2}}}
\;\Longleftrightarrow\;
\boxed{\rho_\Lambda=\kappa^{2}\rho_{\max}} .
\]
No additional fields, free parameters or metric assumptions are
required.  
\[
\boxed{\text{COSMOS} \equiv \text{LOGOS} \equiv \text{GEOMERY}}
\]

\section{Why WILL Has No Hubble Tension}

\subsection*{Statement}
In standard $\Lambda$CDM, a single FRW metric with one scale factor $a(t)$ must simultaneously fit early (CMB) and late (SNe~Ia) data, yielding the well-known ``Hubble tension’’. In WILL geometry there is no FRW metric at all. Cosmology is closed algebraically by energy–projection identities, so any consistent observational pair $(\kappa^2,H_0)$ instantaneously closes the system without internal contradiction.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!80!black,title=No metric no tension]
WILL uses algebraic closures
\[
\kappa^2=\frac{\rho}{\rho_{\max}},\quad 
\rho_{\max}=\frac{H^2}{8\pi G},\quad
\Lambda=\frac{\kappa^2H^2}{c^2},\quad 
H=\frac{c}{r_d},
\]
so CMB and SNe inputs generate self-consistent states without cross-epoch strain.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{Algebraic mechanism}
Given $(H_0,\kappa^2)$ as inputs at an epoch,
\[
\rho_{\max}=\frac{H_0^2}{8\pi G},\qquad 
\rho=\kappa^2\,\rho_{\max},\qquad 
\Lambda=\frac{\kappa^2H_0^2}{c^2},\qquad 
r_d=\frac{c}{H_0},
\]
and the \emph{unified} parameter
\[
Q^2=\kappa^2+\beta^2=3\beta^2,\qquad \kappa^2=2\beta^2.
\]
Energy fractions are \emph{definitions} (see section "Dark Energy as Accumulated Projectional Loss") relative to $Q^2$:
\[
\Omega_m=\frac{\beta^2}{Q^2}=\frac{1}{3},\qquad 
\Omega_\Lambda=\frac{\kappa^2}{Q^2}=\frac{2}{3}.
\]
Hence WILL matches both Planck and SH0ES datasets as two algebraically closed states, not as a single FRW fit forced to reconcile incompatible likelihoods.

\subsection*{Contrast with $\Lambda$CDM}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{$\Lambda$CDM}: $\rho_c=3H^2/(8\pi G)$ and one FRW metric glue early and late probes; inconsistent $H_0$ posteriors generate a genuine model-level tension.
\item \textbf{WILL}: no FRW glue. The identity $\Lambda/H^2=\kappa^2/c^2$ is epoch-wise exact; different $H_0$ inputs simply pick different (but closed) algebraic states.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Two regimes for $\kappa^2$}
\textbf{(I) Fixed-resonance view.} If a global resonance is adopted (e.g., $\kappa^2=2/3$ via the projectional scheme), then
\[
\frac{\Lambda}{H^2}=\frac{\kappa^2}{c^2}=\frac{2}{3c^2},
\]
and \emph{any} measurement of $\Lambda$ predicts $H_0$ (and vice versa). This is a sharp, falsifiable constraint.

\textbf{(II) Measured-\(\kappa^2\) view.} Treat $\kappa^2$ as directly inferred from data at a given epoch ($\kappa^2=\rho/\rho_{\max}$). Then WILL remains strictly parameter-free: $(H_0,\kappa^2)$ are inputs, while all other cosmological quantities are outputs; no FRW cross-epoch consistency is required, so no ``tension’’ arises.
  
\subsection*{What is actually testable}
WILL predicts the \emph{epoch-invariant} ratio
\[
\boxed{\ \frac{\Lambda}{H^2}=\frac{\kappa^2}{c^2}\ }\quad \text{(independent of $Q^2$).}
\]
Thus, across redshifts $z$,
\[
\frac{\Lambda(z)}{H^2(z)}=\frac{\kappa^2(z)}{c^2}
\]
must hold when $\Lambda$ and $\kappa^2$ are inferred independently of FRW assumptions. Any systematic drift beyond uncertainty budgets would falsify the closure.

\subsection*{On contamination by FRW priors}
Many pipeline products embed volume-normalisation ($4/3$) and FRW distance ladders. WILL’s tests should use \emph{ratio} observables or reconstructions minimally dependent on FRW (cosmic chronometers for $H(z)$, time-delay ratios in strong lenses, BAO angle/radius ratios) to avoid importing the very priors that WILL rejects.

\subsection*{Summary}
Hubble ``tension’’ is a FRW artefact: it appears when one metric must serve all epochs. WILL has no such glue; it has algebraic closures per epoch and the invariant $\Lambda/H^2=\kappa^2/c^2$. With the unified parameter $Q^2=\kappa^2+\beta^2$ and $\kappa^2=2\beta^2$, the observed $\Omega_\Lambda:\Omega_m=2:1$ follow as geometric fractions, not as fits. Either the resonance $\kappa^2=2/3$ globally holds—then $H_0$ and $\Lambda$ are locked—or $\kappa^2$ is epoch-measured—then different datasets produce different but self-consistent closures, and there is no internal contradiction to begin with.

\section{Black Hole Entropy in Will Geometry}

\subsection*{Geometric Origin of Entropy}

In Will Geometry, entropy is not a property of an object or hidden internal state. Instead, it arises from an observer’s inability to maintain full projectional coherence across causal boundaries.

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Entropy is the measure of the number of unaccounted-for projectional frames.}
}
\]

When all relevant frames of reference and their associated energy projections are included in the analysis, the total energetic difference between all observers cancels out.

A black hole represents a domain of permanent projectional frame loss. Once an observer crosses the event horizon, their energy projection becomes causally inaccessible. The remaining observer can no longer cancel the energetic asymmetry, leading to entropy.

\subsection{Minimal Entropic Unit}

Consider two observers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $A$ (astronomer) falls into the black hole: \( \kappa_A^2 = 1 \)
    \item $C$ (cosmonaut) remains outside: \( \beta_C^2 = 0.5 \)
\end{itemize}

Prior to causal disconnection:
\[
\Delta E_{A \to C} + \Delta E_{C \to A} = 0
\]

After causal disconnection:
\[
S_C =  (\beta_C^2)^2 =  \frac{1}{4}
\]

This defines the fundamental unit of entropy as:
\[
\boxed{\Delta S = \frac{1}{4}}
\]
\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Entropy arises from the permanent loss of projectional frames.}
}
\]

\subsection{Generalization to Horizon Area}

Let the event horizon consist of \( N \) inaccessible projectional frames. Each contributes a unit asymmetry:

\[
S_{\text{EG}} =  \left( \sum_{i=1}^N \Delta E_i \right)^2 =  N \cdot \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)
\]

Using \( N = A / l_P^2 \), we obtain:

\[
S_{\text{EG}} = \frac{A}{4 l_P^2}
\]

\subsection{Comparison with Hawking Entropy}

This matches the standard form:
\[
S_{\text{BH}} = \frac{k_B A}{4 l_P^2}
\]

with the only difference being the inclusion of the Boltzmann constant \( k_B \), which restores physical units.

\subsection{Interpretation and Consequences}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Entropy is zero only when all relevant energetic projections are accounted for.
    \item Positive entropy reflects a deficiency in geometric awareness — a limitation in the observer's ability to reconstruct the full projectional structure.
    \item The \textbf{arrow of time} emerges naturally as a consequence of asymmetric projectional evolution:
    \[
    \text{Time} \equiv \Delta(\kappa, \beta), \quad \text{and} \quad S \propto |\Delta(\kappa, \beta)_{\text{net}}|
    \]
    \item Irreversibility is not an inherent feature of the universe, but a shadow cast by partial projection.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Key Insight]
Entropy is not a function of internal disorder —\\
it is a function of missing frames in the energetic geometry.\\
Causality is preserved when projection is complete.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Zeno-Type Divergence in Black Hole Infall}

\subsection*{Relational Setup}

Consider two bodies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Object} $B$ falling into a black hole
    \item \textbf{Observer} $O_2$ stationed just inside the Schwarzschild radius at $r = R_s$
\end{itemize}

In WILL geometry, we reject absolute coordinates or privileged observers. All quantities are \textit{relational} and must be defined via energetic projections between causal agents.

Let the encounter between $B$ and $O_2$ occur at $r = R_s$. This implies:
\[
\kappa_B^2 = \kappa_{O_2}^2 = 1
\]

As $B$ continues inward, its projectional escape parameter increases:
\[
\kappa_B^2 > 1
\]

The observer $O_2$, remaining at a fixed radial coordinate, retains:
\[
\kappa_{O_2}^2 = 1
\]

This leads to a projectional divergence:
\[
\Delta \kappa^2 = \kappa_B^2 - \kappa_{O_2}^2
\]

\textbf{Projectional placement of $O_2$.}
A material observer cannot hover at a rigid coordinate radius
$r=R_s$ without infinite thrust.
Instead, we characterise $O_2$ purely by its projectional state
$\kappa_{O_2}^{2}=1$ 
and leave the coordinate label open; this avoids introducing
super-luminal stresses while keeping the relational description intact.

\subsection*{Causal Decoupling Condition}

Causal coherence in WILL geometry is maintained only if the energetic divergence remains below a critical threshold:
\[
\boxed{
\Delta \kappa^2 < 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Coherent Projection Possible}
}
\]

Once:
\[
\boxed{
\Delta \kappa^2 = 1
}
\]
the system reaches the critical point beyond which energetic projection becomes asymmetric and irreversible. This corresponds to a new emergent causal horizon from the observer's point of view.


\textbf{Energetic meaning of the unit threshold.}
The critical value $\Delta\kappa^{2}=1$ is not arbitrary: it is the point where, in the frame of the observer, the local invariant $W_{\text{ill}}=\frac{E\,T^{2}}{M\,L^{2}}$ would soar to \textit{twice} its balanced value, $W_{\text{ill}}^{(O_2)}=2$.
In other words, the projected energy budget and the projected mass–length budget differ by 100\%, breaking the symmetry that normally enforces projectional coherence. Any larger divergence makes reciprocal energetic projection impossible, so a new causal horizon must form.

Solving:
\[
\kappa_B^2 = \kappa_{O_2}^2 + 1 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{R_s}{r} = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \frac{1}{2} R_s
\]

Thus, observer $O_2$ perceives a secondary horizon forming at:
\[
\boxed{r = \frac{1}{2} R_s}
\]


\textbf{Observer-dependence.}
The surface at $r=\frac{1}{2}R_s$ is \emph{not} a universal, metric horizon; it is a horizon for the specific pair $(O_2,B)$. A differently situated agent would in general construct a different inner boundary. Hence these "second horizons" are projectional and observer-dependent, not new absolute structures.


\subsection*{Switching to the Black Hole Surface Frame}

Let us now reformulate the scenario in the projectional system formed by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The falling object $B$
    \item The black hole surface $H$
\end{itemize}

At the initial reference radius $r = R_s$, let the projectional velocity of the object be:
\[
\beta_B = \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{2R_s}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.707
\]

According to WILL geometry, velocity scales as:
\[
\beta^2 = \frac{R_s}{2r}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\boxed{r = \frac{R_s}{2\beta^2}}
\]

Then, the relative projectional velocity between the surface $H$ and the object $B$ becomes:
\[
\Delta \beta = \beta_B - \beta_H
\]

Let us find the radius where this difference reaches unity:
\[
\beta_B - \beta_H = 1
\]

Assuming the surface is initially stationary in its own frame, $\beta_H = 0$, then:
\[
\beta_B = 1 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \frac{R_s}{2r} = 1 \quad\Rightarrow\quad r = \frac{1}{2} R_s
\]


\textbf{Relative, not local, velocity.}
Throughout this section, $\beta$ is a \emph{projectional} (observer-dependent) velocity parameter. Even inside the classical Schwarzschild horizon each infalling body is locally sub-luminal in its proper frame; what reaches $\beta=1$ here is the \emph{relative} projection between the object and the chosen reference surface $H$.


\textbf{Result:}  
The relative velocity between black hole surface and falling object reaches the speed of light at:
\[
\boxed{r = \frac{1}{2} R_s}
\]

This matches the location of the second causal horizon derived from the $O_2$ frame, confirming the symmetry and invariance of the horizon structure under change of observer.

\subsection*{Zeno-Type Causal Cascade}

This logic can be repeated recursively:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduce a new observer $O_3$ just below the new horizon at $r = \frac{1}{2} R_s$
    \item The same divergence occurs as $B$ continues inward
    \item A third horizon appears at $r = \frac{1}{4} R_s$
    \item And so on... until $r_{n}\sim l_P$
\end{itemize}

This generates an infinite causal chain of projectional disconnections:
\[
r_n = \frac{R_s}{2^n}
\quad\text{for } n \in \mathbb{N}
\]


\textbf{Planck cut-off.}
The recursion must terminate once $r_n \lesssim l_P$, because below the Planck scale the smooth projectional manifold is no longer meaningful. The series is therefore finite in physical practice, avoiding an actual Zeno divergence. (this is an assumption based on Standard model, it needs to be tested)


\subsection{Layered Holographic Ledger}

We now marry the projectional Zeno cascade to the WILL holographic principle. Each surface in the cascade is
\[
\boxed{r_n = \frac{R_s}{2^{n}},\qquad\kappa_n^{2}=1}
\]

and carries area $A_n = 4\pi r_n^{2}=A_0\,4^{-n}$ with $A_0=4\pi R_s^{2}$.
Following the WILL derivation of black-hole entropy, the entropy on $\Sigma_n$ is
\[
S_n = \frac{A_n}{4\,l_P^{2}},\qquad
\Delta S_n = S_{n-1}-S_{n}=\frac{3}{4}\,S_{n-1},
\]

so the series $\{\Delta S_n\}$ is geometric and sums exactly to the outer-surface entropy $S_0$.
After $N\simeq\log_2(R_s/l_P)$ steps the innermost layer reaches $r_N\approx l_P$ and $S_N\approx 1$, ending the cascade.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!3, colframe=black!65, title=Layered Holographic Ledger]
The Zeno cascade realises a finite, Planck-terminated stack of balanced surfaces $\{\Sigma_0,\Sigma_1,\ldots,\Sigma_N\}$.
Each shell stores $\Delta S_n=\frac{3}{4}\,S_{n-1}$ bits, so the complete ledger retains exactly $S_0=A_0/(4l_P^{2})$ bits.
No information is lost—only redistributed across nested projectional layers.

\subsection*{Geometric Interpretation}

This recursive disconnection mirrors Zeno's paradox: no matter how close the object $B$ comes to the center, there is always a smaller horizon that forms ahead of it in the observer's projectional frame.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Zeno-Type Causal Structure]
The object $B$ never reaches a final projectional destination — every step forward inwards generates a new boundary of causal coherence. The internal structure of a black hole becomes a nested hierarchy of disjoint causal manifolds.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{Resolution in WILL Geometry}

The paradox dissolves when adopting a fully relational model:
\begin{itemize}
    \item There is no absolute "center" or "final location" for $B$
    \item Each causal horizon marks a transition to a new projectional domain
    \item The manifold is not singular, but hierarchically nested
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion:}  
Black hole interiors in WILL Geometry consist of sequences of projectionally separated causal layers — each inaccessible from the last once the energy symmetry breaks. The fall is not toward a point, but into a structured cascade of coherence domains.


\section{Dark Energy as Accumulated Projectional Loss}

\subsection{Energy Symmetry and Frame Loss}

In Part I, we established the fundamental Energy Symmetry Law:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{external}=\Delta E_{A \to C} + \Delta E_{C \to A} = 0
\end{equation}

This law ensures energetic balance between observers through reciprocal energy projections. However, causal disconnection—such as matter falling beyond event horizons - breaks this symmetry.

\subsection{The Unified Energy Parameter}

The complete energetic structure of any system is captured by the unified parameter:
\begin{equation}
Q^2 = \kappa^2 + \beta^2 = 3\beta^2
\end{equation}

Using the derived relation from part 1, $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$, we obtain:
\begin{align}
Q^2 &= 3\beta^2 = \frac{3}{2}\kappa^2 \\
Q^2 - \kappa^2 &= \beta^2 \quad \text{(kinematic component)} \\
Q^2 - \beta^2 &= \kappa^2 \quad \text{(potential component)}
\end{align}

\subsection{Mechanism of Projectional Loss}

When an observer falls beyond a causal horizon:
\begin{itemize}
\item The external observer retains access only to $\beta^2$
\item The corresponding $\kappa^2$ projection becomes inaccessible
\item Energy Symmetry Law cannot be restored: $\Delta E_{external} \neq 0$
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!70!black, title=Cosmological Imbalance]
\textbf{Dark energy emerges as the cumulative effect of lost $\kappa^2$ projections across all cosmological horizons.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Cosmological Energy Fractions}

From the unified parameter structure, the cosmic energy fractions become:

\begin{align}
\Omega_m &= \frac{\beta^2}{Q^2} = \frac{\beta^2}{3\beta^2} = \frac{1}{3} \\
\Omega_\Lambda &= \frac{\kappa^2}{Q^2} = \frac{2\beta^2}{3\beta^2} = \frac{2}{3}
\end{align}

These ratios are **not empirical fits** but geometric necessities arising from the asymmetric loss of projectional frames.

\subsection{Geometric Resonance at $\kappa^2 = 2/3$}

The cosmological prediction $\kappa^2 = 2/3$ corresponds to the critical geometric configuration where:
\begin{equation}
\kappa^2 + \beta^2 = 1
\end{equation}

This occurs at the photon sphere radius $r = 1.5R_s$, where:
\begin{equation}
\theta_1 = \theta_2 \approx 54.74°
\end{equation}

At this critical angle, energy projections satisfy:
\begin{equation}
\beta = \kappa_X, \quad \kappa = \beta_Y
\end{equation}

The Universe operates at the boundary of causal coherence—balanced on the edge of projectional accessibility.

\subsection{The Cosmological Constant}

The cosmological constant emerges as:
\begin{equation}
\Lambda = \frac{\kappa^2}{r_d^2} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{r_d^2}
\end{equation}

where $r_d = c/H_0$ is the Hubble radius. This yields:
\begin{equation}
\rho_\Lambda = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \rho_{max}
\end{equation}

This exactly reproduces the observed cosmological ratio:
\[
\boxed{
\Omega_\Lambda = \frac{2}{3}, \quad \Omega_m = \frac{1}{3}
}
\]


\subsection{Interpretation}

The Universe operates in a geometric configuration equivalent to the boundary of photon capture. Not a black hole, but a projectional analog: a horizon of causal coherence. The cosmological constant is not mysterious — it is the global projection of this curvature limit.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Projectional Insight]
\textbf{
\(\Lambda\) is the curvature at which information is still marginally projectable.\\
It is the frequency of coherence at the edge of universal causal  disconnection.
}
\end{tcolorbox}

Dark energy is not a mysterious substance but the geometric shadow of energetic incompleteness:

\begin{itemize}
\item It reflects the loss of internal symmetry across cosmic horizons
\item It does not drive expansion - it compensates for broken energy balance
\item It emerges wherever projectional frames become causally inaccessible
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}[On ``local'' vs.~``global'']
In the WILL framework the usual distinction between ``local'' and ``global''
loses its meaning. Without any background manifold there is no external stage
on which to separate neighborhood properties from topological ones.
Quantities such as
\[
\Lambda(r) = \frac{\kappa^2}{r^2}
\]
are neither ``local'' nor ``global'' in the conventional sense, but emerge
directly as structural consequences of the relational principle. The notion
of scale $r$ is itself relational, not a coordinate distance, and thus no
additional normalization factors (such as the familiar ``3'' from FRW
cosmology) appear.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Conclusion}

The critical value \(\kappa^2 = 2/3\) is not an observational coincidence — it is a universal resonance point in the geometry of projection. Lambda is its expression in cosmological scale.

\textit{
The Universe lives balanced on the photon sphere of its own projection.
}
$\boxed{
\text{Balance is not imposed — it is what exists.}
}$


$\boxed{
\text{The Universe simply is the extremum.}
}$


\section{Geometric Derivation of the Equation of State w = -1 from Global Symmetry Principles}

In this section, we provide a rigorous algebraic derivation of the dark energy equation of state w = -1 directly from the fundamental symmetry principles of Will Geometry, without invoking differential calculus or external thermodynamic assumptions.

\subsection{Physical Foundation: Force Balance in Closed Systems}

In Will Geometry, we interpret the fundamental cosmological quantities in terms of directional forces:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Energy density $\rho$}: Creates gravitational attraction → force \textbf{inward}
    \item \textbf{Pressure P}: Creates spatial expansion → force \textbf{outward}
\end{itemize}

For any stable cosmological global configuration, these opposing forces must be balanced to prevent either collapse (ρ dominates) or explosive expansion (P dominates).

\subsection{Global Symmetry Constraint from Will Geometry Foundations}

From the fundamental structure established in Part I, Will Geometry operates under the principle of maximal global symmetry:

\begin{quote}
\textit{"With no external reference, all directions/positions must be equivalent; any asymmetry would require a preferred frame, which is disallowed."}
\end{quote}

This principle imposes a strict geometric constraint on the force balance.

\subsection{Algebraic Derivation}

\subsubsection{Step 1: Symmetry Requirement}

In a maximally symmetric, closed system with no external reference frames:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No preferential directions can exist
    \item All spatial orientations must be equivalent
    \item Any net directional force would violate fundamental symmetry
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Step 2: Force Balance Condition}

The only configuration consistent with maximal symmetry is perfect equilibrium between opposing forces:

\begin{equation}
|\text{Inward Force}| = |\text{Outward Force}|
\end{equation}

Translating to cosmological parameters:
\begin{equation}
|ρc^2| = |P|
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Step 3: Sign Determination}

Since inward and outward forces must have opposite orientations:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{P = -ρc^2}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Step 4: Equation of State}

The cosmological equation of state parameter is defined as:
\begin{equation}
w = \frac{P}{-ρc^2}
\end{equation}

Substituting our symmetry-derived relation:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{w = \frac{P}{-\rho c^2} = -1}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Physical Interpretation}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Geometric Origin of w = -1]
The equation of state w = -1 emerges not as an empirical fit or thermodynamic property, but as a \textbf{geometric necessity} of maximal symmetry in Will Geometry.

This result is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Algebraically exact} - no approximations
    \item \textbf{Geometrically inevitable} - follows from symmetry alone
    \item \textbf{Physically transparent} - represents perfect force balance
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Contrast with Standard Cosmology}

In conventional ΛCDM cosmology, w = -1 is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inserted as an empirical parameter
    \item Justified through vacuum energy arguments
    \item Requires fine-tuning explanations
\end{itemize}

In Will Geometry, w = -1 is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Derived from first principles
    \item Required by geometric symmetry
    \item No free parameters or fine-tuning
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Connection to Cosmological Constant}

This derivation confirms that the cosmological constant Λ represents not a mysterious "vacuum energy," but the manifestation of geometric force balance in a maximally symmetric universe:

\begin{equation}
\boxed{
\Lambda = \frac{\kappa^2}{r_{d}^2} \quad \text{with} \quad w = -1 \quad \text{(symmetry-enforced)}
}
\end{equation}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!4, colframe=black!80!black, title=Foundational Insight]
Dark energy is not a substance or field, but the algebraic expression of geometric symmetry in a closed, self-contained universe. The equation of state w = -1 reflects the fundamental requirement that no preferential directions can exist in the fabric of spacetime itself.
\end{tcolorbox}


\section{From Expansion to Resonance Decay:\\
Hypothesis: Interpreting $H$ as Universal Frequency}

\subsection{Motivation}

In traditional general relativity, gravity is described via spacetime curvature and expressed through the Einstein field equations. In contrast, the Energy Geometry framework proposes that all dynamics are determined by the local transformation rate of spacetime itself, encoded as a frequency \( H \). We begin with the observation that the local Hubble-like frequency is:
\[
H(r) = \frac{c}{r}
\]
which describes the rate of spatial evolution at radial distance \(r\). We posit that gravitational acceleration is not a result of force but of a local deviation in this frequency from the global background.

We hypothesize:
\[
\boxed{
\Phi(r) = \frac{R_s c^2}{2r} = \beta^2c^2=\frac{\kappa^2 c^2}{2} = \left( \frac{R_s}{2} \cdot c \cdot H(r) \right)
}
\]
This suggests that gravitational potential is a scaled expression of the local transformation frequency.

\subsection{Methodology}

To test this, we calculate the gravitational potential in two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Directly from acceleration:
    \[
    a(r) = \frac{\kappa^2 c^2}{2}
    \quad \Rightarrow \quad
    \Phi(r) = -\int a(r) \, dr
    \]

    \item As a scaled geometric frequency:
    \[
    \Phi_{\text{hyp}}(r) = \frac{R_s}{2} \cdot c \cdot H(r)
    \]
\end{enumerate}

We perform numerical integration over a domain \( r \in [1, 100] \, \text{AU} \), assuming a central mass \( M = M_{\odot} \), and compare both potentials.

\subsection{Results}

The computed potentials show near-perfect agreement across the entire range:
\[
\Phi(r) \approx \Phi_{\text{hyp}}(r)
\]
This confirms that the gravitational potential can be interpreted as the scaled local Hubble frequency. No force laws or fields are invoked — only curvature, radius, and the speed of light.

\subsection{Interpretation and Discussion}

This result implies that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gravitational acceleration emerges from the gradient of local transformation frequency.
    \item Potential is the accumulated lag of local geometric phase relative to the global expansion.
    \item The global Hubble parameter \( H_0 \) is the minimal transformation rate and corresponds to the maximum geometric potential:
    \[
    \boxed{
    \Phi_{\text{max}} = c \cdot H_0
    }
    \]
\end{itemize}

Thus, gravity arises from frequency mismatch — not attraction. Objects do not fall due to force but due to the *differential evolution rate of their surrounding space*.

\subsection{Conclusion}

We have shown that gravitational potential can be reinterpreted entirely in terms of geometric frequency. This confirms the Energy Geometry hypothesis that:
\[
\boxed{
\text{Gravity is the accumulated lag of phase transformation across space.}
}
\]
This view unifies local geometry, cosmological expansion, and dynamics without invoking space-time metrics or forces, suggesting a new foundation for gravitational theory.


\subsection{Reinterpreting the COW Experiment as Phase Accumulation from Geometric Frequency Gradient}

The Colella–Overhauser–Werner (COW) experiment demonstrates gravitationally induced quantum interference by splitting a neutron beam into two spatially separated paths and recombining them to observe phase shift. Conventionally, this phase shift is attributed to the gravitational potential difference between the paths:
\[
\Delta \phi = \frac{m g A}{\hbar v}
\]
where \(A\) is the enclosed area, \(v\) the neutron velocity, and \(g\) the gravitational acceleration.

However, within the Energy Geometry framework, this effect is reinterpreted entirely in terms of local geometric frequency. Each neutron trajectory samples a different spatial transformation rate:
\[
H(r) = \frac{c}{r}
\]
and the corresponding gravitational potential becomes:
\[
\Phi(r) = \frac{R_s c^2}{2r} = \frac{R_s}{2} \cdot c \cdot H(r)
\]
Thus, the phase shift is proportional to the accumulated geometric phase lag between trajectories due to their differing evolution rates:
\[
\Delta\phi = \frac{1}{\hbar} \int \left( \Phi_2(t) - \Phi_1(t) \right) \, dt
\]

Since \( \Phi \sim H(r) \), this becomes:
\[
\Delta \phi \propto \int \left( H_2(t) - H_1(t) \right) \, dt
\]
This directly supports the hypothesis that gravity is not a force, but the result of differential phase evolution driven by geometric frequency gradients. The COW experiment thus becomes the first empirical confirmation of gravity as an interference effect of space-time transformation rates.


\section{Will Waves as Dynamic Deviations of Geometric Potential}

We now demonstrate that the Will wave---previously introduced as a transient imbalance between observer and object during the arrival of a geometric perturbation---can be derived directly from the dynamic deviation of the local transformation frequency \( H(r) \), which underlies the gravitational potential.

\subsection*{1. Perturbed Frequency and Potential}

Let the local Hubble-like transformation frequency be momentarily perturbed:
\[
H'(r, t) = \frac{c}{r} + \delta H(t)
\]
This induces a time-dependent geometric potential:
\[
\Phi'(r, t) = \frac{R_s}{2} \cdot c \cdot H'(r, t) 
= \frac{R_s}{2} \cdot c \left( \frac{c}{r} + \delta H(t) \right)
\]

The deviation from the unperturbed potential becomes:
\[
\Delta \Phi(t) = \Phi'(r, t) - \Phi(r) = \frac{R_s}{2} \cdot c \cdot \delta H(t)
\]

\subsection*{2. Will Wave as Relative Deviation}

Recall that in the Energy Geometry model, the Will invariant relates energy, time, length, and mass:
\[
W = \frac{E \cdot T^2}{M \cdot L^2} = 1
\]
A perturbation \(\delta E(t)\) causes a deviation:
\[
\Delta W(t) = \frac{\delta E(t)}{E}
\]
If the energy per unit mass is \(E = \Phi(r)\), then:
\[
\Delta W(t) = \frac{\Delta \Phi(t)}{\Phi(r)} 
= \frac{ \frac{R_s}{2} \cdot c \cdot \delta H(t) }{ \frac{R_s c^2}{2r} } = \frac{r}{c} \cdot \delta H(t)
\]

Therefore:
\[
\boxed{
\Delta W(t) = t_{d} \cdot \delta H(t) \quad \text{with} \quad t_{d} = \frac{r}{c}
}
\]

\subsection*{3. Conclusion}

This confirms that the Will wave is a direct expression of geometric frequency modulation. It is not a field or force carrier, but a transient imbalance in the projectional energy structure caused by delayed reception of transformation rate variation. 

\textit{
Gravitational potential is the integral of static transformation lag.  
Gravitational waves are its dynamic modulation.  
Both are manifestations of the same geometric asymmetry in energy evolution.
