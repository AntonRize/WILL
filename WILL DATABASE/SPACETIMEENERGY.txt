\subsection{Motivation and Core Principle}

The standard formulation of General Relativity often relies on the concept of an asymptotically flat spacetime, introducing an implicit external reference frame beyond the physical systems under study. 
While some modern approaches (e.g., shape dynamics) seek greater relationality, we proceed from strict epistemic minimalism, disallowing all background structures, even hidden or asymptotic ones. 

\textbf{Principle:} \emph{All physical quantities must be defined purely by their relations.} 
Any introduction of absolute properties or external frames risks reintroducing metaphysical artifacts and contradicts the foundational insight of relativity.

\subsection*{What is Energy?}

Across all domains of physics, one empirical fact persists: in every closed system there exists a quantity that never disappears or arises spontaneously, but only transforms in form. This invariant is observed under many guises --- kinetic, potential, thermal, quantum --- yet all are interchangeable, pointing to a single underlying structure.

Crucially, this quantity is never observed directly, but only through \textit{differences between states}: a change of velocity, a shift in configuration, a transition of phase. Its value is relational, not absolute: it depends on the chosen frame or comparison, never on an object in isolation.

Moreover, this quantity provides continuity of causality. If it changes in one part of the system, a complementary change must occur elsewhere, ensuring the unbroken chain of transitions. Thus it is the bookkeeping of causality itself.

From these empirical and relational facts the definition follows unavoidably:

\[
\begin{array}{c} \boxed{ 
\begin{array}{c} 
\text{Energy is the relational measure of difference between possible states,} \\
\text{ conserved in any closed whole and guaranteeing the continuity of causal transitions.} \\ 
\text{It is not an intrinsic property of an object, but }\textbf{ comparative structure}\\ 
\text{ between states (and observers), always manifesting as transformation. }
\end{array} 
} \end{array}
\]


\section{Unifying Hypothesis Removing the Hidden Assumption}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Removing the Hidden Assumption]
Any attempt to treat \emph{``spacetime structure''} as separate from \emph{``dynamics''} smuggles in a background container that is not justified by the phenomena. This violates epistemic hygiene: it introduces an ontological artifact without necessity. Eliminating this separation compels the identification of structure and dynamics as two aspects of a single entity.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{lemma}[False Separation]
\label{lem:false-separation}
Any model that treats processes as unfolding \emph{within} an independent background necessarily assigns to that background structural features (metric, orientation, or frame) not derivable from the relations among the processes themselves. Such a background constitutes an \emph{extraneous absolute}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose an independent background exists. Then at least one of its structural attributes—metric relations, a preferred orientation, or a class of inertial frames—remains fixed regardless of interprocess data. This attribute is not relationally inferred but posited a priori. It thereby violates the relational closure principle: it introduces a non-relational absolute external to the system. Hence the separation is illicit.  
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Structure--Dynamics Coincidence]
\label{cor:coincidence}
To avoid the artifact of Lemma~\ref{lem:false-separation}, the structural arena and the dynamical content must be identified: geometry \emph{is} energy, and energy \emph{is} geometry.
\end{corollary}
\begin{hypothesis}[Working Hypothesis: Removing the Hidden Assumption]
\label{hyp:unifying}
\[
\boxed{\textbf{SPACETIME} \;\equiv\; \textbf{ENERGY}}
\]
This is not introduced as a new ontological entity but as a hypothesis with 
\emph{negative ontological weight}: it removes the hidden unjustified separation 
between “geometry” and “dynamics.” Space and time are not containers but 
emergent descriptors of relational energy.
\end{hypothesis}

\begin{remark}[Auditability]
Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:unifying} is foundational but testable: it is subject to (i) geometric audit (internal logical consequences) and (ii) empirical audit (agreement with phenomena customarily described by SR/GR).
\end{remark}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary:]
\textbf{This hypothesis does not add, it subtracts: it removes the hidden assumption.  Structure and dynamics are two aspects of a single entity - WILL.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Deriving the WILL Structure}

Having established our working hypothesis (Hypothesis \textbackslash{}ref\{hyp:unifying\}) by removing the illicit separation of structure and dynamics, we now proceed to derive its necessary geometric and physical consequences. We will demonstrate that this single principle is sufficient to enforce the closure, conservation, and fundamental symmetries of the relational structure, leading to a unique set of geometric carriers for energy.

\begin{definition}[WILL Geometry]
\label{def:will}
\emph{$ \textbf{WILL}\equiv\ \textbf{SPACE-TIME-ENERGY} $} is the unified relational structure determined by \ref{hyp:unifying} . All physically meaningful quantities are relational features of WILL; no external container is permitted.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Closure]
\label{lem:closure}
Under  \ref{hyp:unifying}, WILL is self-contained: there is no external reservoir into or from which the relational resource can flow.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If WILL were not self-contained, there would exist an external structure mediating exchange. That external structure would then serve as a background distinct from the dynamics, contradicting Corollary~\ref{cor:coincidence}.  
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Conservation]
\label{lem:conservation}
Within WILL, the total relational ``transformation resource'' is conserved.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Lemma~\ref{lem:closure}, no external fluxes exist. Any change in one part of WILL must be balanced by complementary change elsewhere. Hence a conserved global quantity is enforced at the relational level.  
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Isotropy from Background--Free Relationality]
\label{lem:isotropy}
If no external background is allowed (Cor.~\ref{cor:coincidence}), then no direction can be \emph{a priori} privileged. Thus the admissible relational geometry of WILL must be maximally symmetric (isotropic and homogeneous) at the level at which it encodes the conserved resource.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
A privileged direction requires an extrinsic reference to distinguish it. In a purely relational setting, distinctions must be constructible from relations internal to WILL. If a direction were privileged in the geometry that encodes the conserved resource, such privilege would not be derivable from purely internal comparisons (which are symmetric by construction), and would reintroduce an external orienting structure. Therefore the encoding geometry must be maximally symmetric.  
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}[Minimal Relational Carriers of the Conserved Resource]
\label{thm:carriers}
The only closed, maximally symmetric manifolds that can serve as minimal carriers of the conserved relational resource are:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item \(S^1\) for \emph{directional} (one-degree-of-freedom) relational transformation;
        \item \(S^2\) for \emph{omnidirectional} (central, all-directions-equivalent) relational transformation.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By Lemma~\ref{lem:isotropy}, we require closed, maximally symmetric manifolds. 

(a) In one relational degree of freedom, the classification of connected closed $1$-manifolds yields \(S^1\) as the unique (up to diffeomorphism) option. Its isometry group acts transitively with isotropy at each point, providing maximal symmetry.

(b) For omnidirectional relational transformation from a distinguished center, the encoding manifold must be a closed, simply connected, constant positive curvature $2$-manifold with full isotropy at every point. By the uniformization/classification of constant-curvature surfaces, the maximally symmetric representative is \(S^2\). Quotients of \(S^2\) by nontrivial finite groups introduce global identifications that spoil global isotropy; these are excluded by Lemma~\ref{lem:isotropy}. Hence \(S^2\) is uniquely selected.  
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Uniqueness]
\label{cor:uniqueness}
Under \ref{hyp:unifying} with Closure, Conservation, and Isotropy (Lemmas \ref{lem:closure}--\ref{lem:isotropy}), \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) are not optional modeling choices but \emph{necessary} relational carriers for, respectively, directional and omnidirectional modes of energy transformation.
\end{corollary}

\begin{remark}[Non-spatial Reading]
\label{rem:nonspatial}
Throughout, \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) are not to be interpreted as \emph{spacetime} geometries. They are \emph{relational manifolds} that encode the closure, conservation, and isotropy of the transformational resource. Ordinary spatial and temporal notions are emergent descriptors of patterns within WILL.
\end{remark}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary:]
From removing the hidden assumption ~\ref{lem:false-separation} we inevitably arrive to \ref{hyp:unifying}   \(\text{SPACETIME}\equiv\text{ENERGY}\) from there we deduced: (i) closure, (ii) conservation, (iii) isotropy, and hence (iv) the unique selection of \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) as minimal relational carriers for directional and omnidirectional transformation. These objects are non-spatial encodings of conservation and symmetry; they are enforced by the\ref{hyp:unifying} rather than assumed independently.
\end{tcolorbox}


\section{Emergence of Spacetime and The Hypotheses of Geometric Uncertainty}

\textit{In this construction, ``space,'' ``time,'' and the principle of uncertainty are not treated as separate, fundamental aspects of reality. Instead, they are shown to arise as necessary consequences of a single, underlying principle: the geometry of a closed, relational system.}

\subsection{The Duality of Transformation}

\begin{lemma}[Duality of Evolution]
\label{lem:duality}
The identification of spacetime with energy and its transformations necessitates two complementary relational measures:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the \textbf{extent} of transformation (external displacement), and
    \item the \textbf{sequence} of transformation (internal order).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Any complete description of transformation must specify both what changes and how that change is internally ordered. A single measure cannot capture both. The circle $S^1$ provides the minimal geometry enforcing such complementarity: its orthogonal projections furnish precisely two non-redundant coordinates. Therefore the duality of transformation is a geometric necessity, not an arbitrary naming convention. 
\end{proof}

\paragraph{ We define this orthogonal projections as follows:}

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{The Amplitude Component ($\beta_X$):} This projection represents the \textit{relational measure} between the system and the observer. It corresponds to the \textit{extent} of transformation, which manifests physically as momentum (as shown in next section).

    \item \textbf{The Phase Component ($\beta_Y$):} This projection represents the \textit{internal structure} of a system. It governs the intrinsic scale of its proper length and proper time units, corresponding to the \textit{sequence} of its transformation. A value of $\beta_Y=1$ represents a complete and undisturbed manifestation of this internal structure, a state we identify as rest.


\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conservation Law of Relational Transformation}

\begin{theorem}[Conservation Law of Relational transformation]
\label{thm:conservation}
The orthogonal components of transformation $(\beta_X,\beta_Y)$ are bound by the closure relation
\[
\beta_X^2 + \beta_Y^2 = 1.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Since $S^1$ is closed, every point on the circle is constrained by the Pythagorean identity of its projections. Thus no state can exceed or fall short of the finite relational "budget." This closure enforces conservation across all processes. 
\end{proof}

The manifestation of any system is distributed between its internal (Phase) and relational (Amplitude) aspects. This single geometric constraint gives rise to the core phenomena of modern physics:

\subsection{Consequence 1: Relativistic Effects}

\begin{proposition}[Physical Interpretation: Relativistic Effects]
\label{prop:relativity}
The conservation law of Theorem~\ref{thm:conservation} implies that any redistribution between 
the orthogonal components $(\beta_X,\beta_Y)$ manifests physically as the relativistic effects of 
time dilation and length contraction.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{thm:conservation}, the components satisfy $\beta_X^2 + \beta_Y^2 = 1$. 
An increase in the relational displacement $\beta_X$ enforces a decrease in the internal measure $\beta_Y$. 
This reduction of $\beta_Y$ corresponds to dilation of proper time and contraction of proper length, 
while the growth of $\beta_X$ represents momentum. 
Thus the relativistic trade-off is not an additional postulate but the direct physical expression 
of the geometric closure of $S^1$.  
\end{proof}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary:]
\textbf{Geometry of spacetime is nothing but the shadow cast by the geometry of relations.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{(Hypotheses) Consequence 2: The Geometric Uncertainty Principle}

The same conservation law also dictates a geometric analogue to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. The relationship between the Amplitude Component (relational aspect) and the Phase Component (internal aspect) is one of necessary reciprocity.

\begin{itemize}
    \item To perfectly ascertain a system's \textbf{internal structure} ($\beta_Y=1$), its \textbf{relational aspect} must be null ($\beta_X=0$). This is a state of perfect localization (analogous to position) where the relational momentum is zero.

    \item To have a maximal \textbf{relational aspect} ($\beta_X=1$), the system's \textbf{internal structure} must vanish ($\beta_Y=0$). This is analogous to a state of perfectly defined momentum where localization is completely lost.
\end{itemize}

Crucially, unlike the Heisenberg principle which is rooted in the non-commutativity of quantum operators and the constant $\hbar$, this geometric uncertainty arises directly from the single Foundational Hypotheses of a closed, relational universe. The model does not \textit{posit} uncertainty as a strange axiom; it \textit{derives} it as a logical inevitability of its geometry. This suggests that the uncertainty seen in quantum mechanics may be a manifestation of this more fundamental, geometric principle of conservation.


\subsection{(Hypotheses) Geometric Form of Uncertainty}

Let the relational circle $S^{1}$ be parametrized as
\[
\beta_X = \cos\theta_1, \qquad \beta_Y = \sin\theta_1, \qquad \beta_X^2 + \beta_Y^2 = 1.
\]

Small variations are controlled by a single parameter $\theta_1$:
\[
\delta\beta_X = -\sin\theta_1\,\delta\theta_1, 
\qquad 
\delta\beta_Y = \cos\theta_1\,\delta\theta_1.
\]

Thus the corresponding uncertainties are
\[
\Delta\beta_X = |\sin\theta_1|\,\Delta\theta_1, 
\qquad 
\Delta\beta_Y = |\cos\theta_1|\,\Delta\theta_1,
\]
and their product satisfies the identity
\[
\Delta\beta_X \,\Delta\beta_Y 
= \tfrac{1}{2}\,|\sin 2\theta_1|\,(\Delta\theta_1)^2.
\]

In a closed relational system the phase must return to its initial value after a full circuit of $2\pi$. 
This implies that only an \emph{integer number of phase wraps} can be consistently realized. 
We denote this integer by $n$, the \textbf{winding number} or \textbf{phase index}. 
It is a purely topological invariant of the closed geometry and not an externally imposed parameter.

Consequently, the minimal angular step that remains physically distinguishable is set by this winding number:
\[
\Delta\theta_1 \;\gtrsim\; \frac{2\pi}{n}.
\]

Substituting yields the \textbf{geometric uncertainty relation}:
\[
\boxed{\;\Delta\beta_X \,\Delta\beta_Y 
\;\gtrsim\; \tfrac{1}{2}\,|\sin 2\theta_1|\,\Bigl(\tfrac{2\pi}{n}\Bigr)^{2}\;}
\]

\textbf{Physical meaning:} 
The trade-off between the amplitude component ($\beta_X$) and the phase component ($\beta_Y$) is not arbitrary but dictated by the closure of the relational circle and the requirement of integer phase winding. 
This provides a geometric analogue of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle without invoking operator algebra or $\hbar$ as an axiom. 
In this framework, Planck’s constant may be understood as the empirical calibration of the minimal phase grain $(2\pi/n)^2$ to observed dimensional quantities.

\end{tcolorbox}


\section{Kinetic Energy Projection on $S^1$}

Since $S^{1}$ encodes one-dimensional displacement, the total energy $E$ of the system 
must project consistently onto both axes:
\[
E_{X} = E \beta_{X}, 
\qquad 
E_{Y} = E \beta_{Y}.
\]

\begin{theorem}[Invariant Projection of Rest Energy]
\label{thm:restenergy}
For any state $(\beta_X,\beta_Y)$ on the relational circle, the vertical projection of the total energy is invariant:
\[
E \beta_Y = E_0.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
When $\beta_X=0$, closure enforces $\beta_Y=1$, yielding $E=E_0$. 
Since closure applies for all $\theta_1$, the vertical projection $E\beta_Y$ 
remains equal to this rest value in every state.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Total Energy Relation]
\label{cor:totalE}
From Theorem~\ref{thm:restenergy} it follows that
\[
E = \frac{E_0}{\beta_Y} 
= \frac{E_0}{\sqrt{\,1-\beta_X^2\,}}.
\]
\end{corollary}

\begin{remark}[Lorentz Factor]
The historical Lorentz factor $\gamma$ is nothing more than the reciprocal of $\beta_Y$. 
No additional structure is introduced: all content is already present in $E\beta_Y=E_0$.
\end{remark}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary:]
\textbf{The historical Lorentz factor $\gamma$ is nothing more than the reciprocal of $\beta_Y$.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Rest Energy and Mass Equivalence}

\begin{corollary}[Rest Energy and Mass Equivalence]
\label{cor:restmass}
Within the normalization $c=1$, the invariant rest energy equals mass:
\[
E_{0} = m.
\]
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
From the invariant projection $E\beta_Y = E_0$ and closure of $S^1$, no additional scaling parameter is required. 
Hence the conventional bookkeeping identities $E_0 = mc^2$ or $m = E_0/c^2$ reduce to tautologies. 
Mass is therefore not independent, but the rest-energy invariant itself.  
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Epistemic Interpretation]
In a framework that is genuinely fundamental and free from arbitrary human units, 
the natural normalization is always the unique invariant $c=1$. 
With this normalization, the bookkeeping identities $E_0=mc^2$ or $m=E_0/c^2$ lose all significance. 
They collapse into the only consistent statement:
\[
E_{0} = m.
\]

Thus mass is nothing beyond the invariant projection of total rest energy. 
It introduces no new entity and carries no independent meaning apart from $E_0$. 
What is conventionally treated as two quantities is in fact one and the same relational invariant.
\end{remark}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary:]
\textbf{Mass is nothing beyond the invariant projection of total rest energy. .}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Energy--Momentum Relation}

\begin{proposition}[Horizontal Projection as Momentum]
\label{prop:momentum}
On the relational circle, the unique relational measure of displacement from rest is the horizontal projection $E\beta_X$; hence
\[
p \equiv E\beta_X \quad (c=1).
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The rest state is $(\beta_X,\beta_Y)=(0,1)$. A displacement measure must (i) vanish at rest, (ii) grow monotonically with $|\beta_X|$, and (iii) flip sign under $\beta_X\mapsto -\beta_X$. The only relational candidate satisfying (i)–(iii) is the horizontal projection $E\beta_X$. Thus the identification is necessary rather than conventional.  
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Energy--Momentum Relation]
\label{cor:energymomentum}
With $p$ identified by Proposition~\ref{prop:momentum} and $m=E_0$, the closure identity yields
\[
E^{2} = p^{2} + m^{2} \quad (c=1).
\]
Equivalently, upon restoring $c$,
\[
E^{2} = (pc)^{2} + (mc^{2})^{2}.
\]
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
By closure, $(E\beta_X)^2 + (E\beta_Y)^2 = E^2$. Substituting $p=E\beta_X$ and $m=E_0$ proves the claim. 
Restoring $c$ is dimensional bookkeeping: $p\mapsto pc$ and $m\mapsto mc^{2}$, while $E$ remains $E$, yielding the standard form. 
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Geometric Forms]
The same identity may be expressed explicitly in terms of circle coordinates:
\[
E^{2} = \left(\tfrac{\beta_X}{\beta_Y}E_0\right)^{2} + E_0^{2}
= \bigl(\cot(\theta_{1})\,E_{0}\bigr)^{2} + E_{0}^{2}.
\]
These are not alternative parametrizations, but equivalent renderings 
of the same geometric necessity.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Units sanity check — bookkeeping]
Using $\beta_X = v/c$, the identification $p \equiv E\beta_X$ gives
\[
pc = E\,\frac{v}{c}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad p = \frac{E\,v}{c^{2}}.
\]
With $E=\frac{1}{\beta_Y} mc^{2}=\gamma mc^{2}$ this reduces to $p=\frac{\beta_X}{\beta_Y}mc=\gamma m v$, the standard relativistic momentum. No new parameters are introduced.
\end{remark}
