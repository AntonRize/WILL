\section{Methodological Framework}

\subsection{Introduction: Relational State and Energetic Closure}

In WILL RG (Part I), we derive the ontological equivalence principle
$\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY}$ as the consequence of removing the
separation between structure and dynamics. For any closed system, the total
relational shift $Q^2$ is represented on the projection plane spanned by the
kinematic component $\beta^2=(v/c)^2$ and the potential component
$\kappa^2=R_s/r$. For energy-stable systems, the Closure Theorem implies
\begin{equation}
\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2,
\end{equation}
hence the total relational shift is
\begin{equation}
Q^2=\beta^2+\kappa^2 = 3\beta^2.
\end{equation}
This fixes a structural partition of the relational budget and resolves the
discrepancy between local Newtonian inference ($Q^2 \approx \beta^2$) and
galactic-scale dynamics ($Q^2 \approx 3\beta^2$) without introducing extra
mass components.

In RG, geometry is not an external container but a self-consistent global
state. Global persistence requires phase closure on the carrier,
\begin{equation}
\Delta\phi_{\rm global}=2\pi n,\qquad n\in\mathbb{Z}.
\end{equation}

\section{The Necessity of Global Resonance}

Having established that the relational carriers of WILL are topologically
closed (Lemma \ref{lem:closure}), we now derive the consequences of closure
for persistent dynamics.

\begin{lemma}[Inevitability of Self-Interaction]
\label{lem:self-interaction}
In a closed relational carrier $\mathcal{C}$ with finite measure, any
relational perturbation cannot propagate indefinitely without re-encountering
its own wavefront.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $\mathcal{C}$ is compact and boundary-free (Lemma \ref{lem:closure}),
any causal propagation along $\mathcal{C}$ is recurrent.
Therefore the local relational state generically includes contributions from
its own propagated history (echoes).
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Global Phase-Closure Constraint]
\label{thm:resonance}
Persistent modes on a closed relational carrier must satisfy global phase
closure. Modes incompatible with closure do not persist under repeated
self-interaction.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By Lemma \ref{lem:self-interaction}, propagation is recurrent. If the phase
accumulated along a closure path fails to match the phase of the originating
state, repeated re-encounters are generically dephasing. Only modes that are
compatible with closure ($\Delta\phi_{\rm global}=2\pi n$) avoid systematic
dephasing and can persist as stable global structure.
\end{proof}

This means that for the single mode oscillation we will get the Fundamental Tone of the observable Universe.
Our methodology strictly prevents us to accept any absolute empirically measured values like $H_0$, so we will have to derive it ourselves. To find this exact Tone we will relay on the core principal of WILL RG:

$$\boxed{\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY}}$$

\section{Deriving $H_0$ from CMB Temperature and $\alpha$ }

The calculation rests on three foundational premises derived from WILL RG:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Thermodynamic Anchor:} The only model-independent absolute scale available in cosmology is the monopole temperature of the Cosmic Microwave Background ($T_0$). It defines the current radiation energy density $\rho_{\gamma}$.
    
    \item \textbf{The Geometric Scaling Principle (From WILL RG Part III):} The fine-structure constant $\alpha$ is identified not as an arbitrary coupling, but as the kinematic projection of the ground state of matter ($\beta_1 \equiv \alpha$). Consequently, $\alpha^2$ acts as the geometric scaling factor relating the "thermal noise" of radiation to the "structural saturation" of the vacuum.
    
    \item \textbf{The Vacuum Partition (From WILL RG Part B I):} The universe is a geometrically closed system governed by the virial-like condition $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$. This necessitates that the potential (vacuum) energy density $\rho_{\Lambda}$ occupies exactly $2/3$ of the maximal geometric capacity ($\Omega_{pot} = 2/3$).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Input Parameters and Constants}

All input values are taken from standard CODATA (2018) and Planck (2018) datasets. No model-specific fitting parameters are used.

\section{Step-by-Step Derivation}

\subsection{Step 1: Radiation Density Calculation ($\rho_{\gamma}$)}
\textit{Meaning:} Determining the absolute mass-energy density of the photon gas filling the universe. This provides the "Energy" input for the $Spacetime \equiv Energy$ equivalence.

\begin{equation}
    \rho_{\gamma} = \frac{4 \sigma_{SB} T_0^4}{c^3}
\end{equation}
Using the input $T_0 = 2.7255$ K:
\begin{equation}
    \rho_{\gamma} \approx 4.641 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg/m}^3
\end{equation}

\subsection{Step 2: Maximal Geometric Density ($\rho_{max}$)}
\textit{Meaning:} Calculating the saturation density of the geometric field.
\textit{Hypothesis:} The relationship between the radiation background ($\rho_{\gamma}$) and the structural limit ($\rho_{max}$) is mediated by the geometry of the ground state ($\alpha$). Since energy scales as the square of the projection ($E \sim \beta^2$), the scaling factor is $\alpha^2$.

\begin{equation}
    \rho_{max} = \frac{\rho_{\gamma}}{\alpha^2}
\end{equation}
Using $\alpha \approx 7.297 \times 10^{-3}$ ($\alpha^2 \approx 5.325 \times 10^{-5}$):
\begin{equation}
    \rho_{max} \approx \frac{4.641 \times 10^{-31}}{5.325 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 8.715 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg/m}^3
\end{equation}

\subsection{Step 3: Vacuum Energy Density ($\rho_{\Lambda}$)}
\textit{Meaning:} Determining the effective density of the vacuum that drives expansion.
\textit{Logic (WILL RG Part B I):} In a closed WILL system, the potential sector ($\kappa^2$) accounts for $2/3$ of the total resource ($\Omega_{pot} = 2/3$).

\begin{equation}
    \rho_{\Lambda} = \Omega_{pot} \cdot \rho_{max} = \frac{2}{3} \rho_{max}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \rho_{\Lambda} \approx \frac{2}{3} (8.715 \times 10^{-27}) \approx 5.810 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg/m}^3
\end{equation}

\subsection{Step 4: The Hubble Constant ($H_0$)}
\textit{Meaning:} Converting the vacuum tension into the expansion rate parameter.
\textit{Logic:} Using the standard Friedman relation for a flat universe dominated by this vacuum density. The geometric relation simplifies to:

\begin{equation}
    H_0 = \sqrt{4\pi G \rho_{\Lambda}}
\end{equation}

\section{Results and Numerical Calculation}

Substituting the derived $\rho_{\Lambda}$ into the final equation:

\begin{align*}
    H_0 &= \sqrt{4\pi \cdot (6.674 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (5.810 \times 10^{-27})} \\
    H_0 &= \sqrt{4.873 \times 10^{-36}} \\
    H_0 &\approx 2.2075 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{s}^{-1}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Unit Conversion}
Converting from SI units ($s^{-1}$) to standard cosmological units (km/s/Mpc):
$$ \text{Conversion Factor} = \frac{3.0857 \times 10^{22} \text{ m/Mpc}}{1000 \text{ m/km}} \approx 3.0857 \times 10^{19} $$

\begin{equation}
    H_0 \approx 2.2075 \times 10^{-18} \times 3.0857 \times 10^{19} \approx \mathbf{68.11} \, \text{km/s/Mpc}
\end{equation}

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}

The calculated value $H_0 \approx 68.1$ km/s/Mpc is derived without any free parameters or model fitting. It relies exclusively on the measured CMB temperature and the assumption that the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ represents the geometric scaling of the vacuum.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Comparison with Planck (2018):} The Planck result is $67.4 \pm 0.5$ km/s/Mpc. Our result deviates by approximately $+1.0\%$.
    \item \textbf{Comparison with SH0ES (2019):} The local ladder measurement is $74.0 \pm 1.4$ km/s/Mpc. Our result supports the "Early Universe" (CMB) measurements.
    \item \textbf{Methodological Implication:} The high precision of this result suggests that the "Hubble Tension" may not be a crisis of measurement, but a confirmation that the Universe operates as a geometrically closed system where micro-constants ($\alpha$) and macro-parameters ($H_0$) are rigidly locked.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion:} WILL Relational Geometry successfully bridges Quantum Mechanics (WILL RG Part III) and Cosmology (WILL RG Part I and II), yielding a theoretically grounded value for $H_0$ that matches observations.


\section{The Horizon Tone and the Hubble Parameter}

\subsection{Causal Horizon and Principal Frequency}

Let $R_H$ denote the causal horizon scale of the closed carrier. The
principal closure path has length
\begin{equation}
\lambda_0 = 2\pi R_H,
\end{equation}
so the corresponding linear frequency is
\begin{equation}
f_0=\frac{c}{\lambda_0}=\frac{c}{2\pi R_H}.
\end{equation}
Operationally we define the horizon scale by the measured Hubble rate,
\begin{equation}
R_H \equiv \frac{c}{H_0},
\end{equation}
which yields the fundamental Tone of the observable Universe
\begin{equation}
f_0=\frac{H_0}{2\pi}.
\end{equation}
\subsection{Structural Partition Factor}

From energetic closure ($\kappa^2=2\beta^2$), the structural fraction of the
total relational budget is
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{pot}=\frac{\kappa^2}{\kappa^2+\beta^2}=\frac{2}{3}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Resonant Acceleration Scale}

Define the raw horizon-scale acceleration associated with the primary
mode as
\begin{equation}
a_{raw}=c\,f_0=\frac{cH_0}{2\pi}.
\end{equation}
In RG, gravitational response tracks the structural projection fraction of
the relational budget; therefore the effective horizon-coupled acceleration
scale is weighted by $\Omega_{pot}=\kappa^2/Q^2$:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{
a_{Mach}=\Omega_{pot}\,a_{raw}=\frac{2}{3}\cdot\frac{cH_0}{2\pi}
=\frac{cH_0}{3\pi}.
}
\end{equation}

\section{Derivation of the Dimensionless Projection Law}

We derive galactic dynamics strictly from the geometry of WILL projections, relying solely on operational length scales.

\subsection{The Geometric Ratios}
The state of a gravitational system is defined by two dimensionless ratios relative to the cosmic topology:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Local Projection ($\beta_{loc}^2$):}
    The kinematic projection associated with the local "curvature" scale ($R_s$). It represents depth of the potential well at radius $r$:
    \begin{equation}
    \beta_{loc}^2(r) = \frac{R_s}{2r}
    \end{equation}
    Here, $R_s=\frac{2GM}{c^2}=\kappa^2r$ is the operational length scale defining the local system's scale.

    \item \textbf{The Global Scale Ratio ($\Phi_H$):}
    The constant dimensionless ratio relating the system's local capacity ($R_s$) to the causal horizon of the Universe ($R_H$):
    \begin{equation}
    \Phi_H = \frac{R_s}{R_H}
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Law of Resonant Projection}
In a causally closed system, the total observed projection $\beta_{obs}^2$ constitutes the superposition of the local "curvature" and a \textbf{Global Floor}term arising from the interference between the local scale and the global topology.

Using the $3\pi$ resonant closure derived with Machian acceleration ($a_{Mach}$), the interaction term emerges as the geometric mean of the local and global projection scales. Crucially, the radial distance $r$ cancels out, leaving a shell-constant topological invariant:

\begin{equation}
\beta_{int}^2 = \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{2r} \cdot \left(\frac{r}{3\pi R_H}\right)} = \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{6\pi R_H}} = \sqrt{\frac{\Phi_H}{6\pi}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{The Dimensionless Equation}
The total observable kinetic state is the sum of the decaying local projection and this shell-constant global invariant:

$$\beta_{obs}^2(r)=\left(v_{bary}^{2}+\sqrt{v_{bary}^{2}a_{Mach}r}\right)\ \frac{1}{c^{2}}= \beta_{loc}^2(r) + \sqrt{\frac{\Phi_H}{6\pi}}$$

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:beta_pred}
\boxed{\beta_{obs}^2(r) = \beta_{loc}^2(r) + \sqrt{\frac{\Phi_H}{6\pi}}}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Geometric Necessity}
This equation contains no physical units or empirical force constants. It states a necessary geometric relationship:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Near the center ($r \to 0$), the local "curvature" $\beta_{loc}^2$ dominates ($1/r$ scaling).
    \item At the outskirts ($r \to \infty$), the system hits the \textbf{Global Floor}, manifesting as a constant orbital velocity determined solely by the ratio $\Phi_H$ of the galaxy's operational scale to the universe's horizon.
\end{itemize}


\section{Empirical Verification}

\section{Protocol-Independent Empirical Comparison on SPARC}

\subsection{Motivation and Protocol}

The central empirical challenge addressed here is the discrepancy between observed galactic rotation velocities and the predictions of Newtonian gravity sourced solely by baryons. Standard analyses often employ complex error weighting, likelihood maximization, and galaxy-specific parameter tuning (e.g., varying mass-to-light ratios), which can obscure the distinction between a model's predictive power and its parametric flexibility.

Our objective is to assess whether a fixed physical prescription reproduces the kinematic structure of disk galaxies in a transparent, assumption-minimal manner. We adopt a deliberately austere protocol:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{No Parameter Tuning:} No free parameters are adjusted per galaxy.
    \item \textbf{Fixed Mass-to-Light Ratios:} We adhere to standard population synthesis values without variation.
    \item \textbf{Raw Deviation Metrics:} We evaluate raw residuals without weighting by observational uncertainties, preventing the suppression of physical systematics by error bars.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data}

We utilize the SPARC database (Table~2), comprising $175$ disk galaxies. Observed circular velocities $V_{\rm obs}(r)$ and baryonic components ($V_{\rm gas}, V_{\rm disk}, V_{\rm bulge}$) are taken directly from the catalog. To ensure physical causality, negative baryonic velocity components (artifacts of observational noise decomposition) are truncated to zero prior to squaring.

\subsection{Baryonic Reference Model}

The baryonic circular velocity is defined as:
\begin{equation}
V_b^2(r) = V_{\rm gas}^2(r)
+ \Upsilon_{\rm disk} V_{\rm disk}^2(r)
+ \Upsilon_{\rm bulge} V_{\rm bulge}^2(r).
\end{equation}
We adopt fixed mass-to-light ratios consistent with population synthesis expectations for the 3.6 $\mu$m band (Lelli et al., 2016):
\[
\Upsilon_{\rm disk} = 0.5, \qquad
\Upsilon_{\rm bulge} = 0.7.
\]
These values are applied uniformly to all galaxies and are strictly fixed.

\subsection{Dynamical Prescriptions Evaluated}

Five distinct physical prescriptions are compared.

\subsubsection{1. Newtonian Baseline}
\[ V_{\rm Newt}(r) = V_b(r). \]

\subsubsection{2. LCDM with Abundance Matching (No Fitting)}
To represent the Standard Model without allowing ad-hoc halo fitting, we employ the Abundance Matching protocol.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Halo mass $M_{200}$ is estimated from the total stellar mass $M_{\star}$ using the inversion of the stellar-to-halo mass relation from Moster et al. (2013).
    \item Halo concentration $c_{200}$ is derived from the mass-concentration relation of Dutton \& Macciò (2014) for the Planck cosmology.
    \item The resulting NFW halo velocity $V_{NFW}(r)$ is added in quadrature to the baryons.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{3. MOND (Standard Benchmark)}
We employ the standard interpolation function $\mu(x) = x/(1+x)$ with the canonical acceleration scale $a_0 = 1.2 \times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-2}}$. The prediction is given analytically by the solution to the algebraic quadratic equation:
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm MOND}(r) = \sqrt{ \frac{V_b^2(r) + \sqrt{V_b^4(r) + 4V_b^2(r)a_0 r}}{2} }.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{4. Emergent Gravity (Verlinde, 2016)}
We test the theoretical scaling proposed by Verlinde, where the acceleration scale is determined by the Hubble parameter $H_0$. Using the theoretical coefficient $1/6$:
\begin{equation}
a_{\rm VG} = \frac{c H_0}{6} \approx 1.1 \times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-2}}.
\end{equation}
The velocity profile follows the Deep-MOND scaling for point masses:
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm Verlinde}(r) = \sqrt{ V_b^2(r) + \sqrt{a_{\rm VG} V_b^2(r) r} }.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{5. WILL Relational Geometry (RG)}
The RG prediction is structurally similar to the geometric mean scaling but employs a distinct coefficient derived from the theory's potential resonance condition ($3\pi$):
\begin{equation}
V_{\rm RG}(r) = \sqrt{ V_b^2(r) + \sqrt{a_{\rm Mach} V_b^2(r) r} }.
\end{equation}
Crucially, the acceleration scale $a_{\rm Mach}$ is \textbf{not fitted} and is not based on external $H_0$ measurements. It is derived exclusively from the CMB temperature $T_0$ and the fine-structure constant $\alpha$:
\begin{equation}
a_{\rm Mach} = \frac{c H_0}{3\pi}, \quad \text{where } H_0 \equiv \sqrt{8\pi G \rho_{\gamma}/(3\alpha^2)}.
\end{equation}
This yields a theoretical $H_0 \approx 68.15$ km/s/Mpc and $a_{\rm Mach} \approx 0.70 \times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-2}}$.

\subsection{Results}

Performance is evaluated using three robust metrics: Median Absolute Error (MedAE), Median Signed Bias (systematic offset), and the fraction of data points predicted within $10$ km/s ($F_{10}$).

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Global performance metrics on the full SPARC sample ($N=175$). Values represent the median across all galaxies.}

LCDM (Abundance Matching) & 28.69 & $+27.66$ & 0.14 \\\hline
MOND (Standard $a_0$) & \textbf{10.43} & $-4.37$ & \textbf{0.48} \\\hline
Verlinde ($a_0=cH_0/6$) & 12.27 & $-8.52$ & 0.33 \\\hline
WILL RG ($a_0=cH_0/3\pi$) & 11.18 & \textbf{$-2.26$} & 0.47 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Analysis of Gas-Dominated Systems}
To isolate physical validity from stellar mass-to-light ratio uncertainties, we analyze the subset of galaxies dominated by gas ($M_{gas} > M_{\star}$, $N=32$). In this regime, the baryonic mass distribution is known with high precision.

WILL RG ($1/3\pi$) & \textbf{7.00} & \textbf{$+0.53$} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{img/rar_gas_binned_final.png}
    \caption{Grey points represent raw data; black squares denote binned means with standard error of the mean (SEM).

    \label{fig:RAR_Gas}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Discussion and Interpretation}

The comparison yields three structurally significant results:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Inefficacy of Statistical Dark Matter:} The LCDM model, when constrained by the global stellar-to-halo mass relation (Abundance Matching) rather than individual fitting, fails to reproduce rotation curves, exhibiting a systematic bias ($+27.7$ km/s) comparable to the Newtonian baseline. This indicates that Dark Matter halos require galaxy-specific fine-tuning to match observations.

    \item \textbf{Systematic Overprediction in Modified Gravity:} Both standard MOND ($a_0 \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-10}$) and Verlinde's Emergent Gravity ($a_0 \approx 1.1 \times 10^{-10}$) exhibit a negative bias, systematically overpredicting rotation velocities. This is most pronounced in gas-dominated systems, where both models overestimate velocities by $>5$ km/s.

    \item \textbf{Geometric Precision of the $3\pi$ Resonance:} WILL RG using an acceleration scale derived purely from thermodynamic constants ($a_{\rm Mach} \approx 0.70 \times 10^{-10}$), eliminates the systematic bias found in other models. In the high-precision gas-dominated regime, the bias is negligible ($+0.53$ km/s).
\end{enumerate}

These results suggest that the "missing mass" phenomenon is governed by a specific geometric coupling constant ($1/3\pi$) derived from the Horizon resonant structure, rather than by the entropic statistical average ($1/6$) or empirically fitted parameters. Unlike MOND, which fits $a_0$ to minimize residuals, WILL RG predicts the residuals of MOND ($a_0^{WILL} < a_0^{MOND}$) and corrects them solely from first principles derived from the CMB temperature.



\subsection{The Universal Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR)}

We subjected the WILL framework to the rigorous Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) test using the full SPARC database (175 galaxies, $>3000$ data points). Unlike standard Dark Matter models, which treat the halo as a free component with arbitrary fitting parameters for each galaxy, WILL RG predicts a rigid, universal functional relationship between the baryonic acceleration $g_{bar}$ and the observed acceleration $g_{obs}$.

\subsubsection{The Zero-Parameter Prediction}
The theoretical curve is derived solely from the \textbf{Geometric Mean Interference} principle established in Section 1.4. The observed acceleration is the superposition of the local Newtonian field and the global vacuum impedance:

\begin{equation}
g_{obs} = g_{bar} + \sqrt{g_{bar} \cdot a_{Mach}}
\end{equation}

Crucially, the global acceleration scale $a_{Mach}$ is \textbf{not fitted} to the galaxy data. It is fixed entirely by the Cosmological Anchor derived in \textit{Part B} from the CMB temperature ($T_0$) and the fine-structure constant ($\alpha$):

\begin{equation}
a_{Mach} = \frac{c H_0}{3\pi} \approx 7.02 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m/s}^2
\end{equation}
where $H_0 \approx 68.1$ km/s/Mpc is the theoretically derived Hubble parameter.

\subsubsection{Statistical Validation}
Figure \ref{fig:rar} demonstrates the resulting "Main Sequence of Galaxies". Despite the vast diversity of morphological types—ranging from gas-dominated dwarfs to massive high-surface-brightness spirals—the data collapses onto the single theoretical curve predicted by Eq. (14).

The statistical analysis of the residuals (logarithmic deviation) yields:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):} $0.065$ dex.
    \item \textbf{Mean Offset:} $0.007$ dex (approx. $1.5\%$).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion:} The theory matches observations with zero systematic bias and a scatter consistent with observational uncertainties. This confirms that the "mass discrepancy" attributed to Dark Matter is, in reality, a deterministic geometric interference effect governed by the Universal Horizon scale ($H_0$).

The cyan line represents the WILL Resonance Interference prediction ($g_{obs} = g_{bar} + \sqrt{g_{bar}a_{Mach}}$) using the $H_0$ value derived from CMB thermodynamics. The remarkable agreement ($\text{RMSE} \approx 0.065$ dex) without free parameters confirms that galactic dynamics are regulated by the global horizon.}
    \label{fig:rar}
\end{figure}


\section{Relational Inertia: The Phantom Mass Scaling}
\label{sec:phantom-mass}

\subsection{Theoretical Prediction}

RG predicts that observed inertial mass deviates from the source mass $M$ according to the normalized distance from the gravitational center:

\begin{equation}
\frac{M_{\text{obs}}}{M} = 1 + \frac{r}{R_{\text{bubble}}}
\label{eq:phantom-scaling}
\end{equation}

where the characteristic scale $R_{\text{bubble}}$ emerges from the total relational shift $Q$ and the geometric mean of cosmological $R_H$ and local $r$ scales:

\begin{equation}
R_{\text{bubble}} = \sqrt{\pi Q^{2}R_{H}r}
\label{eq:bubble-radius}
\end{equation}

Here $Q^2 = \beta^2 + \kappa^2$ represents the norm of total relational shift, $R_H = c/H_0$ is the Hubble radius, and $r=R_s/\kappa^2$ is the radial distance from the source mass.

This prediction is parameter-free: given that $H_0 = 68.1$ km/s/Mpc is RG first principle prediction and the visible mass distribution, Eq.~(\ref{eq:phantom-scaling}) determines the apparent mass at any radius without adjustable constants.

\subsection{Observational Data}

We tested this prediction against the SPARC database \citep{Lelli2016}, containing 175 galaxies with high-quality rotation curve measurements. For each galaxy, we computed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Source mass} $M(r)$: Enclosed baryonic mass from gas, stellar disk, and bulge components
    \item \textbf{Observed inertial mass} $M_{\text{obs}}(r) = V_{\text{obs}}^2 r / G$: Mass inferred from rotation velocity
    \item \textbf{Normalized radius}: $r/R_{\text{bubble}}$ where $R_{\text{bubble}}$ is computed from Eq.~(\ref{eq:bubble-radius})
\end{itemize}

The dataset spans 3,350 independent measurements across diverse galaxy types (spirals, dwarfs, irregulars) covering four orders of magnitude in mass ($10^8$ to $10^{12} M_{\odot}$).

\subsection{Results}

Figure~\ref{fig:phantom-mass} shows the inertial amplification factor $M_{\text{obs}}/M$ as a function of normalized radius. The data collapse onto a universal linear relation, precisely matching the WILL prediction (cyan line).

Statistical analysis in logarithmic space yields:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RMSE}: 0.054 dex (5.4\% typical error)
    \item \textbf{MAE}: 0.043 dex 
    \item \textbf{Bias}: +0.015 dex (statistically negligible)
    \item \textbf{Mean relative error}: 9.7\%
\end{itemize}

The residual scatter is consistent with observational uncertainties in stellar mass-to-light ratios and gas fraction estimates. No systematic deviation from linearity is observed across the full range $0.1 < r/R_{\text{bubble}} < 30$.

\subsection{Interpretation}

This result demonstrates three key points:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{No dark matter required}: The linear scaling law Eq.~(\ref{eq:phantom-scaling}) accounts for galactic dynamics with zero free parameters, eliminating the need for non-baryonic dark matter halos.
    
    \item \textbf{Universal geometric scale}: The bubble radius $R_{\text{bubble}}$, derived purely from relational geometry ($Q^2 = \beta^2 + \kappa^2$), correctly predicts where Newtonian dynamics breaks down across all galaxy types.
    
    \item \textbf{Cosmological connection}: The dependence on $H_0$ through $R_H$ explains why galaxy rotation curves encode information about the cosmic expansion rate—traditionally attributed to coincidental scaling in modified gravity theories.
\end{enumerate}

The 5\% accuracy achieved without parameter fitting compares favorably to alternative frameworks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{MOND}: Requires fitted acceleration scale $a_0$, achieves RMSE $\sim$ 0.13 dex \citep{McGaugh2016}
    \item \textbf{$\Lambda$CDM}: Demands individual dark matter halo profiles per galaxy, often fails for low-surface-brightness systems \citep{Oman2015}
\end{itemize}

We interpret ``phantom mass'' as an \emph{observational artifact}: when measuring inertia in a relationally-structured spacetime using Newtonian coordinates, the geometric shift $Q$ manifests as apparent excess mass. The linear form of Eq.~(\ref{eq:phantom-scaling}) arises because relational shift accumulates proportionally with distance from the causal anchor (the source mass $M$).

\subsection{Connection to Flat Rotation Curves}

The linear scaling $M_{\text{obs}} \propto r$ directly produces the observed flat rotation curves $V = \text{const}$:

\begin{equation}
V^2 = \frac{GM_{\text{obs}}}{r} = \frac{GM(1 + r/R_{\text{bubble}})}{r} \xrightarrow{r \gg R_{\text{bubble}}} \frac{GM}{R_{\text{bubble}}} = \text{const}
\end{equation}

This resolves the historical puzzle: flat rotation curves are not evidence of dark matter, but rather the signature of linear relational scaling in the vacuum-dominated regime ($r > R_{\text{bubble}}$).


\section{Discussion: The Unified Scale Invariance}

The condition for galactic stability derived here mirrors the quantization condition for the atom derived in Part III.

\textbf{System} & \textbf{Microcosm (Atom)} & \textbf{Macrocosm (Galaxy)} \\

\textbf{Closure Condition} & Standing Wave & Horizon Resonance \\\hline
\textbf{Geometric Equation} & $2\pi r_n = n \lambda_e$ & $r_{limit} = \pi Q^2 R_H$ \\\hline
\textbf{Topological Limit} & Planck Constant ($h$) & Hubble Horizon ($R_H$) \\

\end{tabular}

\small\textit{Note: In the microcosm comparison, $n$ denotes the principal quantum number and $\lambda_e$ is the electron Compton wavelength. These standard quantum mechanical terms are included solely to illustrate the scale-invariant geometric analogy.}
\vspace{1em}

Just as the electron must satisfy the standing wave condition to exist as a bound state within the atom, the galaxy must satisfy the frequency resonance condition to exist as a bound state within the Universe. The "Dark Matter" phenomenon is the observational signature of this scale-invariant geometric closure.
