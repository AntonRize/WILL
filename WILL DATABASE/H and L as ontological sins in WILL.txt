\begin{abstract}
This paper, the first in the WILL series, introduces a new theoretical framework that shifts the paradigm from a descriptive to a \textbf{generative model} of physics, providing a unified derivation of Special and General Relativity from first principles. The model is founded on the \textbf{single postulate} that $\boxed{\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION}}$, from which all physical laws are deductively derived without free parameters. Key results include: the \textit{ab initio} geometric derivation of the energy-momentum relation ($E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$); a fundamental unifying equation, $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$, which is shown to be a necessary consequence of the topology of the underlying projection manifolds; and an algebraic field equation, $\frac{R_s}{r_{d}} = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{max}}$, that serves as a local equivalent to Einstein's Field Equations.

By construction, this geometric approach \textbf{inherently resolves the problem of singularities} by imposing a natural maximum on curvature, and it successfully \textbf{reconstructs the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics} from its core projections. The framework offers significant \textbf{conceptual clarity and computational simplicity} by replacing complex tensor formalism with transparent geometric relations. Furthermore, it demonstrates complete \textbf{theoretical closure} (the "Theoretical Uroboros"), wherein the foundational postulate deductively leads to a field equation that fully embodies it. The model's predictions are shown to be in precise agreement with key empirical tests, including the precession of Mercury, GPS time corrections, and the orbital decay of binary pulsars, establishing a robust foundation for subsequent papers on cosmology (Part II) and quantum mechanics (Part III).

\section{Foundational Approach}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Guiding Principle]
\textbf{Nothing is assumed. Everything is derived.}\\
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection {Methodological Purity}
This framework is built from a single postulate and zero free parameters. This construction is not a simplification — it is a deliberate epistemic constraint. No assumptions are introduced unless they follow strictly from first principles, and no constructs are retained unless they are geometrically or energetically necessary. 

\subsection*{No Ontological Commitments}
This model makes no ontological claims about the "existence" of space, particles, or fields. Instead, all phenomena are treated as observer-dependent energetic projections.

\subsection{Epistemic Hygiene}
Modern physics often tolerates hidden assumptions: arbitrary constants, external backgrounds, or abstract entities with ambiguous physical status. 
Here we enforce \textbf{epistemic hygiene}: a refusal to import unjustified assumptions. 
All physical quantities emerge purely from relational geometry and causal closure.

\subsection{Motivation and Core Principle}

The standard formulation of General Relativity often relies on the concept of an asymptotically flat spacetime, introducing an implicit external reference frame beyond the physical systems under study. 
While some modern approaches (e.g., shape dynamics) seek greater relationality, we proceed from strict epistemic minimalism, disallowing all background structures, even hidden or asymptotic ones. 

\textbf{Principle:} \emph{All physical quantities must be defined purely by their relations.} 
Any introduction of absolute properties or external frames risks reintroducing metaphysical artifacts and contradicts the foundational insight of relativity.

\subsection*{What is Energy?}

Across all domains of physics, one empirical fact persists: in every closed system there exists a quantity that never disappears or arises spontaneously, but only transforms in form. This invariant is observed under many guises --- kinetic, potential, thermal, quantum --- yet all are interchangeable, pointing to a single underlying structure.

Crucially, this quantity is never observed directly, but only through \textit{differences between states}: a change of velocity, a shift in configuration, a transition of phase. Its value is relational, not absolute: it depends on the chosen frame or comparison, never on an object in isolation.

Moreover, this quantity provides continuity of causality. If it changes in one part of the system, a complementary change must occur elsewhere, ensuring the unbroken chain of transitions. Thus it is the bookkeeping of causality itself.

From these empirical and relational facts the definition follows unavoidably:

\[
\begin{array}{c} \boxed{ 
\begin{array}{c} 
\text{Energy is the relational measure of difference between possible states,} \\
\text{ conserved in any closed whole and guaranteeing the continuity of causal transitions.} \\ 
\text{It is not an intrinsic property of an object, but }\textbf{ comparative structure}\\ 
\text{ between states (and observers), always manifesting as the potential for transformation. }
\end{array} 
} \end{array}
\]


Any attempt to treat ``spacetime structure'' as something separate from ``dynamics'' already introduces a hidden assumption. 
It presupposes that reality can be divided into a static container and an evolving content. 
From the standpoint of epistemic hygiene, such a division is inadmissible: it brings in an ontological artifact without necessity. 
By removing this assumption, we are compelled to identify structure and dynamics as two aspects of a single entity.

\section{Single Unifying Postulate}

Once the false division between structure and dynamics is removed, the unique remaining formulation is that the geometry of relations \emph{is} the evolution itself. 
This leads directly to the unifying postulate:

\[
\boxed{\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION}}
\]

\textbf{Clarification:} 
By ``energy evolution'' we mean the total structure of possible transitions between observable states---not a process unfolding in spacetime, but the very relational geometry from which both space and time emerge. 
This is not a derived result, but a foundational postulate, subject to geometric and empirical audit in subsequent sections. 
``WILL'' is used here as a technical term for this unified, emergent structure.

The goal of this framework is not merely to reconstruct the formulas of Special and General Relativity, but to demonstrate that they are the unique and necessary consequences of a single, deeper principle of relational geometry. 
By showing \textit{why} these specific mathematical structures must arise, the model provides a more fundamental explanation for them than the standard formalisms alone.

\subsection{Structure of WILL}
$\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION}$ \textit{is not a metaphorical equivalence, but a topologically enforced identification: The closure, isotropy, and conservation of energetic transformations allow only one geometrical substrate: a manifold where structure \textit{is} transformation. }

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Self-contained structure:} Since spacetime and energy evolution are one and the same, no external container can exist. Any attempt to imagine energy as ``sitting'' inside a background would reintroduce the forbidden separation between structure and dynamics. 
Therefore the system must be entirely self-contained.
    
    \item \textbf{Conservation law:} Because the configuration is closed, nothing enters or leaves. 
This closure enforces conservation: the total relational energy cannot vary.
    
    \item \textbf{Symmetry/isotropy:} Without an external reference, every direction must be equivalent. 
If one direction were privileged, the hidden background would reappear. 
Thus perfect symmetry is unavoidable.
    
    \item \textbf{Circular/spherical configuration:}  Among all possible closed manifolds, only those possessing the \textbf{highest degree of symmetry (isotropy)} — where every point and every direction is indistinguishable - can serve as our foundation. If one direction were privileged, a hidden background would reappear. This stringent requirement of perfect isotropy uniquely selects the circle and the surface of a sphere. Bouth exhaust the relational budget without leaving hidden asymmetries. In one dimension the unique possibility is the circle $S^{1}$; in two dimensions it is the surface of a sphere $S^{2}$. These are not spatial objects but relational manifolds: they encode the closure of energetic relations themselves. 
\end{enumerate}


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=IMPORTANT:]
Throughout this work, $S^1$ and $S^2$ are not to be interpreted as spacetime geometries but purely as relational manifolds encoding conservation. Any reading otherwise is a misinterpretation.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Emergence of Spacetime and Geometric Uncertainty}

\textit{In this construction, ``space,'' ``time,'' and the principle of uncertainty are not treated as separate, fundamental aspects of reality. Instead, they are shown to arise as necessary consequences of a single, underlying principle: the geometry of a closed, relational system.}

\subsection{The Duality of Evolution}

Once the postulate identifies spacetime with energy evolution, the apparent separation of reality into ``space'' and ``time'' must be derived. This derivation begins with a critical methodological question: how do we bridge the abstract geometry of the $S^1$ manifold with physical concepts without resorting to arbitrary naming?

The answer is found within the logical requirements of the term ``evolution'' itself. Any complete description of change requires two inseparable and complementary measures:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A measure for the \textbf{extent} of transformation (what has changed).
    \item A measure for the \textbf{sequence} or internal state of that transformation (how it has changed).
\end{enumerate}

The relational geometry of the circle, $S^1$, provides the unique, minimal structure that perfectly embodies this required duality. We therefore do not arbitrarily name its orthogonal projections, but \textit{recognize} them as the geometric substrates for these two aspects of evolution. We define them as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Phase Component ($\beta_Y$):} This projection represents the \textit{internal structure} of a system. It governs the intrinsic scale of its proper length and proper time units, corresponding to the \textit{sequence} of its evolution. A value of $\beta_Y=1$ represents a complete and undisturbed manifestation of this internal structure, a state we identify as rest.

    \item \textbf{The Amplitude Component ($\beta_X$):} This projection represents the \textit{relational measure} between the system and the observer. It corresponds to the \textit{extent} of transformation, which manifests physically as momentum.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Fundamental Law of Conservation}

These two components are not independent but are bound by the fundamental conservation law of the closed system, which acts as a finite ``budget of reality'':
$$
\beta_X^2 + \beta_Y^2 = 1
$$
The manifestation of any system is distributed between its internal (Phase) and relational (Amplitude) aspects. This single geometric constraint gives rise to the core phenomena of modern physics.

\subsection{Consequence 1: Relativistic Effects}

The redistribution of the budget between the Phase and Amplitude components directly produces the effects of Special Relativity. An increase in the relational measure ($\beta_X$, momentum) necessarily requires a decrease in the measure of the internal structure ($\beta_Y$). This geometric trade-off is observed physically as length contraction and time dilation. Thus, the geometry of spacetime is nothing but the shadow cast by the geometry of relations.

\subsection{Consequence 2: The Geometric Uncertainty Principle}

The same conservation law also dictates a geometric analogue to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. The relationship between the Amplitude Component (relational aspect) and the Phase Component (internal aspect) is one of necessary reciprocity.

\begin{itemize}
    \item To perfectly ascertain a system's \textbf{internal structure} ($\beta_Y=1$), its \textbf{relational aspect} must be null ($\beta_X=0$). This is a state of perfect localization (analogous to position) where the relational momentum is zero.

    \item To have a maximal \textbf{relational aspect} ($\beta_X=1$), the system's \textbf{internal structure} must vanish ($\beta_Y=0$). This is analogous to a state of perfectly defined momentum where localization is completely lost.
\end{itemize}

Crucially, unlike the Heisenberg principle which is rooted in the non-commutativity of quantum operators and the constant $\hbar$, this geometric uncertainty arises directly from the single postulate of a closed, relational universe. The model does not \textit{posit} uncertainty as a strange axiom; it \textit{derives} it as a logical inevitability of its geometry. This suggests that the uncertainty seen in quantum mechanics may be a manifestation of this more fundamental, geometric principle of conservation.


\subsection{Geometric Form of Uncertainty}

Let the relational circle $S^{1}$ be parametrized as
\[
\beta_X = \cos\theta_1, \qquad \beta_Y = \sin\theta_1, \qquad \beta_X^2 + \beta_Y^2 = 1.
\]

Small variations are controlled by a single parameter $\theta_1$:
\[
\delta\beta_X = -\sin\theta_1\,\delta\theta_1, 
\qquad 
\delta\beta_Y = \cos\theta_1\,\delta\theta_1.
\]

Thus the corresponding uncertainties are
\[
\Delta\beta_X = |\sin\theta_1|\,\Delta\theta_1, 
\qquad 
\Delta\beta_Y = |\cos\theta_1|\,\Delta\theta_1,
\]
and their product satisfies the identity
\[
\Delta\beta_X \,\Delta\beta_Y 
= \tfrac{1}{2}\,|\sin 2\theta_1|\,(\Delta\theta_1)^2.
\]

In a closed relational system the phase must return to its initial value after a full circuit of $2\pi$. 
This implies that only an \emph{integer number of phase wraps} can be consistently realized. 
We denote this integer by $n$, the \textbf{winding number} or \textbf{phase index}. 
It is a purely topological invariant of the closed geometry and not an externally imposed parameter.

Consequently, the minimal angular step that remains physically distinguishable is set by this winding number:
\[
\Delta\theta_1 \;\gtrsim\; \frac{2\pi}{n}.
\]

Substituting yields the \textbf{geometric uncertainty relation}:
\[
\boxed{\;\Delta\beta_X \,\Delta\beta_Y 
\;\gtrsim\; \tfrac{1}{2}\,|\sin 2\theta_1|\,\Bigl(\tfrac{2\pi}{n}\Bigr)^{2}\;}
\]

\textbf{Physical meaning:} 
The trade-off between the amplitude component ($\beta_X$) and the phase component ($\beta_Y$) is not arbitrary but dictated by the closure of the relational circle and the requirement of integer phase winding. 
This provides a geometric analogue of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle without invoking operator algebra or $\hbar$ as an axiom. 
In this framework, Planck’s constant may be understood as the empirical calibration of the minimal phase grain $(2\pi/n)^2$ to observed dimensional quantities.

\section{Relational Energy and Rest State}

Since $S^{1}$ encodes one-dimensional displacement, the total energy of the system must project consistently onto both axes. 
Each coordinate $(\beta_{X},\beta_{Y})$ multiplies the same total magnitude $E$, producing the projection pair
\[
E_{X} = E \beta_{X}, 
\qquad 
E_{Y} = E \beta_{Y}.
\]

\subsection{Rest Energy as Necessary Projection}

When $\beta_{X}=0$ (the relational displacement vanishes), the circle condition enforces $\beta_{Y}=1$. 
At this point the vertical projection alone remains, and the energy reduces to
\[
E_{Y} = E \cdot 1.
\]
This state is uniquely identified as the invariant rest energy:
\[
E_{0} \equiv E \beta_{Y} \quad \text{when } \beta_{X}=0.
\]

\subsection{Invariant Relation}

Because closure applies for all $\theta_{1}$, the vertical projection must remain constant across all states. 
Thus the unique invariant relation is
\[
\boxed{E \beta_{Y} = E_{0}}.
\]
\subsection{Total Energy}

From the invariant relation $E \beta_{Y} = E_{0}$ the total energy follows uniquely as
\[
E = \frac{E_{0}}{\beta_{Y}}.
\]

Since the closure condition enforces $\beta_{Y} = \sqrt{1-\beta_{X}^{2}}$, this can also be written as
\[
E = \frac{E_{0}}{\sqrt{\,1-\beta_{X}^{2}\,}}.
\]

No additional parameter is required. The historical ``Lorentz factor'' is nothing more than the reciprocal of $\beta_{Y}$ and adds no new structure. 
The full content is already present in the relation $E \beta_{Y} = E_{0}$.

\subsection{Rest Energy and Mass}

In a framework that is genuinely fundamental and free from arbitrary human units, the natural normalization is always given by the unique invariant $c=1$. 
With this normalization, the bookkeeping identities $E_{0} = mc^{2}$ or $m = E_{0}/c^{2}$ lose all significance. 
They collapse into the only consistent statement:
\[
E_{0} = m.
\]

Thus mass is nothing beyond the invariant projection of total rest energy. 
It introduces no new entity and carries no independent meaning apart from $E_{0}$. 
What is conventionally treated as two quantities is in fact one and the same relational invariant.

\subsection{Energy--Momentum Relation}

From the orthogonal projections it follows that the horizontal component is
\[
p \;\equiv\; E \beta_{X}.
\]

Together with the invariant vertical projection $E \beta_{Y} = E_{0}$, the circle closure enforces
\[
(E \beta_{X})^{2} + (E \beta_{Y})^{2} = E^{2}.
\]

Substituting $p = E \beta_{X}$ and $m = E_{0}$ yields the unique energy--momentum relation:
\[
E^{2} = p^{2} + m^{2}.
\]

\subsection{Geometric Forms}

This relation can be written in equivalent ways, making explicit the role of the circle geometry:

\[
E^{2} = \left(\frac{\beta_{X}}{\beta_{Y}}E_{0}\right)^{2} + E_{0}^{2},
\]

or, in angular form,
\[
E^{2} = \bigl(\cot(\theta_{1})\,E_{0}\bigr)^{2} + E_{0}^{2}.
\]

These are not alternative parametrizations but the same identity expressed through the coordinates of the relational circle. 
The algebraic form $E^{2} = p^{2} + m^{2}$ is simply the most compact expression of this geometric necessity.

\section{Potential Energy Projection on $S^2$}

Analogous to $S^1$ the relational geometry of the sphere, $S^2$, provides orthogonal projections,  for two aspects of omnidirectional evolution. We define them as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Amplitude Component ($\kappa_Y$):} This projection represents the \textit{relational gravitational measure} between the object and the observer. It corresponds to the \textit{extent} of transformation, which manifests physically as gravitation potential. A value of $\kappa_Y=1$ corresponds precisely to the point where escape velocity equals the speed of light, creating an event horizon. This provides a natural causal limit for our gravitational parameter, analogous to the relative motion it determinant by the same radial normalization r=c=1.

    \item \textbf{The Phase Component}\textbf{ ($\kappa_X$):} This projection governs the intrinsic scale of its proper length and proper time units, corresponding to the \textit{sequence} of its evolution.
\end{itemize}

These two components are not independent but are bound by the fundamental conservation law of the closed system, which acts as a finite ``budget of reality'':
$$
\kappa_X^2 + \kappa_Y^2 = 1
$$
The manifestation of any system is distributed between its internal (Phase) and relational (Amplitude) aspects. This single geometric constraint gives rise to the core phenomena of modern physics.

\subsection{Consequence: Gravitational Effects}

The redistribution of the budget between the Phase and Amplitude components directly produces the effects of General Relativity. An increase in the relational measure ($\kappa_Y$, gravitation potential) necessarily requires a decrease in the measure of the internal structure ($\kappa_X$). This geometric trade-off is observed physically as gravitational length and time corrections. Thus, the geometry of spacetime is nothing but the shadow cast by the geometry of relations.


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Notation simplicity:]
From here on we will wright  \(\beta=\beta_X , \quad \beta_Y=\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}},\quad  \kappa=\kappa_Y , \qquad \kappa_{X} = \sqrt{1 - \kappa^{2}}\) for notation simplicity.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Gravitational Tangent Formulation}

Just as the relativistic energy--momentum relation can be expressed in terms of the kinematic projection 
$\beta = v/c$, we may construct its gravitational analogue using the potential projection 
$\kappa = v_{e}/c$, where $v_{e}$ is the escape velocity at radius $r$. 

In the kinematic case, with $\beta = \cos\theta_{1}$, the energy relation can be written as
\begin{equation}
    E^{2} = \bigl(\cot\theta_{1}\,E_{0}/c\bigr)^{2} + E_{0}^{2},
\end{equation}
so that the relativistic momentum is expressed as
\begin{equation}
    p = E_{0}/c\,\cot\theta_{1}.
\end{equation}

In full symmetry, the gravitational case follows from $\kappa = \sin\theta_{2}$. 
We define the gravitational energy as
\begin{equation}
    E_{g} = \frac{E_{0}}{\kappa_{X}}, 
    \qquad \kappa_{X} = \sqrt{1 - \kappa^{2}},
\end{equation}
and introduce the gravitational analogue of momentum:
\begin{equation}
    p_g \;=\; E_{0}/c\,\tan\theta_{2}.
\end{equation}

This yields the gravitational energy relation
\begin{equation}
    E_{g}^{2} = p_g^{2} + E_{0}^{2}.
\end{equation}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!60!black, title=Relational Symmetry:]
\[
\beta = \cos\theta_{1}, 
\qquad 
\kappa = \sin\theta_{2},
\]
\[
\beta \;\longleftrightarrow\; \kappa,
\qquad
\cot\theta_{1} \;\longleftrightarrow\; \tan\theta_{2}.
\]

Kinematic momentum $p$ and gravitational momentum $k$ are thus dual 
projections of the same relational circle, expressed through complementary 
trigonometric forms.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Geometric composition of SR and GR factors}

The multiplicative law
\[
\boxed{\;E_{\rm loc}=\dfrac{E_0}{\beta_Y\,\kappa_X}\;}
\qquad
\left(\beta_Y=\sqrt{1-\beta^2},\; \kappa_X=\sqrt{1-\kappa^2}\right)
\]
has a direct geometric interpretation as a \emph{composition of two independent
right–triangle scalings} on the unit circles of the kinematic and gravitational
projections.

\paragraph{Geometric proof (one line).}
On the unit circle, the vertical leg equals the cosine (kinematics: $\beta_Y=\cos\theta_1$;
gravity: $\kappa_X=\cos\theta_2$). To keep the \emph{same invariant vertical leg} $E_0$
after rescaling the hypotenuse, the hypotenuse must be stretched by the reciprocal
of that cosine:
\[
E=\frac{E_0}{\beta_Y},\qquad E_g=\frac{E_0}{\kappa_X}.
\]
Applying first the SR rescaling and then the GR rescaling multiplies the
stretch factors, hence the local scale (frequency/energy of a clock or photon)
is
\[
\boxed{\;E_{\rm loc} \;=\; \frac{E_0}{\beta_Y}\times\frac{1}{\kappa_X}
\;=\; \frac{E_0}{\beta_Y\,\kappa_X}\; }.
\]

\paragraph{Remarks.}
(1) The two triangles live on different unit circles (kinematic $S^1$ and gravitational $S^2$ projection);
their scalings are independent and therefore compose multiplicatively.
(2) If a line-of-sight Doppler factor is relevant, it multiplies the SR part,
but the SR$\times$GR factorization remains intact.

\section{Relation Between Potential and Kinetic Energy Projections}

\subsection{The Topological Necessity of \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) Projections}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title= \textbf{Important clarification:}]
These are not spatial objects, but abstract topological constructs encoding the conservation law and closure of energy relations. 
\end{tcolorbox}

The postulate \(\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION}\) is not a vague metaphor but a precise geometric constraint. It demands that all physical quantities emerge from the relational structure of transitions between observable states. This structure must be:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Self-contained:} There is no external background.
    \item \textbf{Conservative:} The total "resource" for evolution is fixed.
    \item \textbf{Maximally Symmetric:} No point or direction is privileged.
\end{enumerate}

These are not additional assumptions; they are the \textit{operational definitions} of what it means for spacetime to be identical to energy evolution. Any geometry violating these principles would reintroduce an absolute background, violating the postulate.

The fundamental question is: \textit{What are the unique geometric arenas that can host such a complete description of physical evolution?}

We must now characterize the types of "energy evolution" that constitute physics. There are two, and only two, fundamental classes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Class I (Directional Evolution):} This describes a transition whose character is defined by a \textit{preferred axis}. The act of measurement is the act of distinguishing this axis (e.g., the line connecting observer and object for relative velocity). The energy measure is inherently tied to a specific direction. This is the domain of kinematics.
    \item \textbf{Class II (Omnidirectional Evolution):} This describes a transition whose character is \textit{inherently without a preferred axis}. The act of measurement is the act of establishing a relation to a center, but the resulting field is defined equally in all directions from that center. This is the domain of a static, central potential.
\end{itemize}

These are not arbitrary choices. They are an exhaustive catalogue of the fundamental relational categories implied by the postulate. Class I isolates a single degree of freedom for measurement. Class II encompasses the full set of directional possibilities from a point.

The geometry must now accommodate these classes while obeying the three constraints above.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{For Class I (Directional):} The only closed, 1-dimensional manifold of constant positive curvature is the circle, \(S^1\). It is unique. It is maximally symmetric (all points and rotations are equivalent). It is self-contained and embodies conservation (the fixed radius). \textbf{Therefore, the kinematic parameter \(\beta\) must be a projection on \(S^1\). There is no other option.}
    \item \textbf{For Class II (Omnidirectional):} The only closed, simply-connected 2-dimensional manifold of constant positive curvature is the sphere, \(S^2\). It is unique. It is maximally symmetric (all points and rotational axes are equivalent). It is self-contained. \textbf{Therefore, the gravitational parameter \(\kappa\) must be a projection on \(S^2\). There is no other option.}
\end{itemize}

Closed, self-contained universe requires that the "total space of possibilities" for each projection mode be complete. The fundamental, dimensionless measure for the completeness of these geometries is their full angle:

\begin{itemize}
    \item For the circle ($S^1$), the total available "configurational space" is its full angle of closure: $2\pi$.
    \item For the sphere ($S^2$), the total available "configurational space" is its full angle of closure: $4\pi$.
\end{itemize}

The ratio of the total angular measures of these two fundamental manifolds is a pure, dimensionless number dictated by their intrinsic topology:
\[
\frac{\text{Total Closure of $S^2$}}{\text{Total Closure of $S^1$}} = \frac{4\pi}{2\pi} = 2
\]

This factor of 2 is a direct and necessary consequence of the dimensional difference between an omnidirectional (2D) and a linear (1D) projection space.
\begin{quote}\small
Here both $2\pi$ and $4\pi$ are the \emph{complete closure measures} of $S^1$ and $S^2$. 
\textbf{Not spatial objects, but abstract topological constructs.}
They are universal, dimensionless invariants: the full angle of a closed loop and the full angle of a closed surface. Their ratio is therefore a pure number, reflecting the intrinsic topological difference between one- and two-dimensional projection spaces.
\end{quote}
\subsection{The Quadratic Nature of Energetic Projections}

To translate this purely geometric ratio into a physical law, we must consider how projections relate to energy. In physics, the energetic significance (or "power") of a field, velocity, or wave is proportional not to its amplitude, but to its \textbf{amplitude squared}. This quadratic relationship is fundamental, appearing in kinetic energy ($E_k \propto v^2$), potential energy in fields, and the energy density of electromagnetic waves ($E \propto A^2$).

Furthermore, in any projectional geometry, the magnitudes of orthogonal components are related to the whole via a Pythagorean sum of squares. Therefore, the conserved evolution resource is distributed among the squares of its projections. The fundamental relation must connect the ratio of the \textit{energetic significances} of the modes ($\kappa^2$ and $\beta^2$) to the underlying topological ratio of their geometric arenas.

This leads to the unique and necessary unification equation:
\[
\frac{\kappa^2}{\beta^2} = 2 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \boxed{\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2}
\]

\paragraph{Important Clarification.}
This factor of 2 is not an empirical constant, a Newtonian mechanical result, or a coincidence of orbital dynamics. It is a direct consequence of the ratio of the fundamental angular measures that define the complete projection spaces for omnidirectional and linear phenomena.

\paragraph{Closure Condition.}
The relation $\kappa^2=2\beta^2$ is therefore more than a proportionality: it is the precise criterion for energetic closure. Whenever the equality is satisfied, the system under study is fully self-contained, with no leakage of the conserved resource into unaccounted channels. Whenever the equality \emph{appears} to fail (for instance in highly elliptical binaries or in radiating systems), this does not contradict the principle but indicates that additional energy pathways --- such as gravitational-wave emission or cosmological expansion --- must be included to restore the balance. In this sense, the relation acts as a diagnostic invariant: it tells us whether our description has captured the full closed geometry or whether unseen flows remain.

\subsection{Closure, Falsifiability, and the Conservation of Energy}

The relation $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$ must be understood not merely as a proportionality, but as the precise geometric criterion for the \textbf{energetic closure} of a system. In this framework, it serves as the direct geometric embodiment of the Law of Conservation of Energy.

Any apparent deviation from this equality is therefore not a failure of the principle. Instead, it acts as a powerful diagnostic tool that presents a definitive epistemic choice:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The System is Incompletely Defined:} The observer has failed to account for all energy channels. The deviation is a physical signature of an unaccounted-for process (e.g., gravitational-wave emission, mass accretion, or other energy flows). The relation thus becomes a predictive instrument, compelling the discovery of these flows to restore the geometric balance.

    \item \textbf{A Violation of Fundamental Conservation:} If, hypothetically, a system were proven to be perfectly closed with all energy flows rigorously accounted for, and the relation $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$ was still systematically violated, this would imply a failure of the Law of Conservation of Energy itself.
\end{enumerate}.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=The Principle as a Diagnostic Invariant]
The relation $\boxed{\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2}$ holds if and only if the system under study is energetically closed. An apparent violation is not a contradiction of the theory, but a physical prediction that energy is flowing through an unaccounted-for channel. The principle is therefore falsifiable, with its falsification being equivalent to demonstrating a violation of energy conservation.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{Illustrative Examples}

To clarify the meaning of this closure condition, consider two contrasting cases:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Circular Orbit (Closed Subsystem).}  
    For a test body in a perfectly circular orbit around a central mass, the condition $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$ is exactly fulfilled. The orbital system can be treated as energetically closed: all of the conserved resource is accounted for between the kinetic projection along the orbit and the gravitational projection toward the center. No external channels are needed, and the equality signals full closure.

    \item \textbf{Radiating Binary (Open Subsystem).}  
    In contrast, for a highly elliptical binary system of compact objects (such as neutron stars. (full calculation in section: Empirical Validation; subsection: Orbital Decay: Binary Pulsar)), the orbital evolution is accompanied by gravitational-wave emission. If one considers only the orbital mechanics, the relation $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$ will appear to be violated. Yet this is not a failure of the principle. Instead, it reveals that the subsystem is not closed: part of the resource leaves through radiation. When the gravitational-wave channel is included in the balance, the closure is restored and the equality holds again.
\end{itemize}

These examples highlight the diagnostic role of the relation: it identifies whether the chosen subsystem is complete, or whether additional flows of the evolution resource must be incorporated to recover closure.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Principle of Closure.}  
The relation $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$ holds if and only if the system under consideration is fully closed, with no leakage of energy into channels not included in the description.
\end{quote}

The factor of 2 in the fundamental relation \(\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2\)  is the ratio of the total solid angle of the sphere (\(4\pi\) steradians) to the total planar angle of the circle (\(2\pi\) radians). This ratio is the geometric exchange rate between the two unique manifolds that host the two fundamental categories of energy evolution.

\vspace{1em}
\noindent\textbf{In summary:} 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The postulate defines the universe as a closed, conservative, symmetric relational structure.
    \item The physical content of that universe consists of two and only two fundamental types of relations: directional and omnidirectional.
    \item The mathematics of geometry dictates that the \textit{only} closed, maximally symmetric arenas for these relations are \(S^1\) and \(S^2\), respectively.
    \item Therefore, the projection parameters \(\beta\) and \(\kappa\) are \textit{forced} to live on these \textbf{non-spatial} manifolds.
\end{enumerate}



It is the \textit{only geometrical content} that can be housed within the geometric constrains dictated by the fundamental postulate.

\paragraph{Physical Implication.}
In WILL Geometry, this relation is foundational. It links gravitational and kinetic modes without reference to spacetime as a background fabric, showing that their connection is a matter of geometric and topological necessity, not dynamic coincidence. Classical physics, in its successful predictions, unknowingly traces the consequences of this deeper geometric law.

\[
\boxed{\text{Spacetime Geometry (}\kappa^{2}\text{)} \;\equiv\; \text{Kinematic Energy distribution (}\beta^{2}\text{)}\;\times\;2}
\]
\[
\boxed{\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION}}
\]

\subsection{Geometric Relationships}

The relativistic and gravitational factors can be expressed in unified algebraic and trigonometric forms, as shown in Table 1.

\end{table}



\subsubsection{The Combined Energy Parameter $Q$}

The total energy projection parameter unifies both aspects:

\begin{align}
    Q &=\sqrt{\kappa^2 + \beta^2}  \\
    Q^{2}&= 3\beta^2 = \frac{3}{2}\kappa^2 = \frac{3R_s}{2r_{d}} \\
    Q_t &= \sqrt{1-Q^2} = \sqrt{1-\kappa^2-\beta^2} = \sqrt{1-3\beta^2} = \sqrt{1-\frac{3}{2}\kappa^2} \\
    Q_r &= \frac{1}{Q_t}
\end{align}

These describe the combined effects of relativity and gravity.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Unified Interpretation]
The familiar SR and GR factors emerge here as projections of the same conserved geometry. 
Relativistic ($\beta$) and gravitational ($\kappa$) modes are not separate “effects” but dual aspects of one energy-evolution constraint revealing their unified origin.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Energy–Symmetry Law}\label{sec:energy-symmetry}

\subsection{Causal Continuity and Energy Symmetry}
\begin{theorem}[Energy Symmetry]
The energy differences perceived by two observers at different positions balance according to the Energy–Symmetry Law:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Consider two observers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Observer $A$ at rest on the surface at radius $r_A$.
\item Observer $B$ orbiting at radius $r_B > r_A$ with orbital velocity $v_B$.
\end{itemize}
Each observer perceives energy transfers differently due to gravitational and kinetic differences:
From $A$'s perspective (surface → orbit):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Object gains potential energy by moving away from gravitational center.
\item Object gains kinetic energy by accelerating to orbital velocity.
\end{enumerate}
This results in energy difference:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\Delta E_{A \to B} = \frac{1}{2}\left((\kappa_A^2 - \kappa_B^2) + \beta_B^2\right)}
\end{equation}
From $B$'s perspective (orbit → surface):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Object loses gravitational potential energy descending into stronger gravitational field.
\item Object loses kinetic energy by reducing velocity from orbital speed to rest.
\end{enumerate}
This results in energy difference:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\Delta E_{B \to A} = \frac{1}{2}\left((\kappa_B^2 - \kappa_A^2) - \beta_B^2\right)}
\end{equation}



Summing these transfers:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{lemma}[Quadratic budget difference]
Define the quadratic budget $Q^2 \equiv \kappa^2+\beta^2$. For any two relationally defined states $A,B$, set
\[
\Delta E_{A\to B} \;\equiv\; \frac{1}{2}\bigl(Q_A^2 - Q_B^2\bigr),\qquad
\Delta E_{B\to A} \;\equiv\; \frac{1}{2}\bigl(Q_B^2 - Q_A^2\bigr).
\]
Then $\Delta E_{A\to B} + \Delta E_{B\to A} = 0$ identically. This is a purely relational symmetry under the exchange $A\leftrightarrow B$ and does not rely on any specific potential model.
\end{lemma}
Thus, no net energy is created or destroyed, confirming the Energy–Symmetry Law.
\end{proof}
\subsection{Observer-Agnostic Symmetry}
\begin{theorem}[Observer-Agnostic Energy Symmetry]
The Energy–Symmetry Law holds true independent of the specific model of gravitational or kinetic energy:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0 \quad \forall f(v)
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Regardless of the chosen energy function $f(v)$ representing kinetic or gravitational energy differences, consistency demands that:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0.
\end{equation}
The crucial point is mutual consistency, not specific energy definitions.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Physical Meaning of Factor $\frac{1}{2}$}

The factor $\frac{1}{2}$ does not originate from classical mechanics, but from the geometric nature of the quadratic form that measures the ``evolution budget'' $Q^2 = \kappa^2 + \beta^2$. 

When comparing two nearby states, the change in this quadratic form is
\[
\delta Q^2 = (\kappa_2^2 - \kappa_1^2) + (\beta_2^2 - \beta_1^2).
\]
In energetic terms, only \emph{half} of this variation is attributed to the ``active'' transfer in one direction, because the other half belongs to the reciprocal change seen from the opposite frame. This division is the same geometric reason why kinetic energy in classical mechanics is $K = \frac12 m v^2$: the quadratic metric is naturally paired with a factor $\frac12$ when representing stored or exchanged energy.

Thus:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gravitational potential term: $U \propto -\frac{1}{2}\kappa^2$.
\item Kinetic term: $K \propto \frac{1}{2}\beta^2$.
\end{itemize}
The $\frac12$ reflects the symmetric partition of a quadratic budget between mutually consistent perspectives, not an externally imposed convention.

\subsection{Universal Speed Limit as Consequence of Energy Symmetry}
\begin{theorem}[Universal Speed Limit]
The universal speed limit ($v \leq c$) emerges naturally from Energy–Symmetry conditions.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Assume an object could exceed the speed of light ($\beta > 1$). In that scenario:
\begin{itemize}
\item The kinetic component ($\beta^2$) surpasses unity excessively, causing an irreversible imbalance in energy transfer.
\item No reciprocal transfer could balance this energy, breaking the fundamental symmetry:
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} \neq 0
\end{equation}
Thus, $\beta \leq 1$ ($v \leq c$) is required intrinsically to preserve causal and energetic consistency.
\end{proof}
In essence, WILL Geometry encodes the principle that:
\begin{quote}
The speed of light is the boundary beyond which the energetic symmetry between perspectives breaks down. Causality is not an external rule but a built-in feature of the universe's energetic geometry.
\end{quote}

\section{Classical Keplerian Energy as a WILL--Minkowski Projection}

A striking consequence of the Energy--Symmetry Law is that, when the
zero of gravitational potential is chosen on the surface of the central body
rather than at infinity, the total specific orbital energy (potential $+$ kinetic,
per unit mass) naturally appears in \emph{Minkowski form}.

\subsection{Classical Result with Surface Reference}

For a test body of mass $m$ on a circular orbit of radius $a$ about
a central mass $M_\oplus$ (Earth in our example),
classical Newtonian mechanics gives:
\begin{align}
\Delta U &= -\frac{GM_\oplus m}{a} + \frac{GM_\oplus m}{R_\oplus},\\
K &= \frac12 m\frac{GM_\oplus}{a}.
\end{align}
Adding these and dividing by the rest--energy $E_0 = m c^2$ yields
the dimensionless total:
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{\text{tot}}}{E_0}
= \frac{GM_\oplus}{R_\oplus c^2}
 - \frac12\frac{GM_\oplus}{a c^2}.
\label{eq:classical_surface}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Projection Parameters and Minkowski Form}

Define the WILL projection parameters for the surface and the orbit:
\begin{align}
\kappa_\oplus^2 &\equiv \frac{2GM_\oplus}{R_\oplus c^2},\\
\beta_{\text{orbit}}^2 &\equiv \frac{GM_\oplus}{a c^2}.
\end{align}
Substituting into \eqref{eq:classical_surface} gives the exact identity:
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{\text{tot}}}{E_0}
= \frac12\bigl(\kappa_\oplus^2 - \beta_{\text{orbit}}^2\bigr).
\label{eq:will_minkowski_energy}
\end{equation}

This is already in the form of a \emph{hyperbolic difference of squares}:
if we set $x \equiv \kappa_\oplus$ and $y \equiv \beta_{\text{orbit}}$, then
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{\text{tot}}}{E_0} = \frac12\,(x^2 - y^2),
\end{equation}
which is structurally identical to a Minkowski interval in $(1+1)$ dimensions,
up to the constant factor $\frac12$.

\subsection{Physical Interpretation}

In classical derivations, \eqref{eq:classical_surface} is just the sum
$\Delta U + K$ with a particular choice of potential zero.
In the WILL framework, \eqref{eq:will_minkowski_energy} emerges directly from the
energy--symmetry relation:
\[
\Delta E_{A\to B}
= \frac12\bigl((\kappa_A^2 - \kappa_B^2) + \beta_B^2\bigr),
\]
with $(A,B) = (\text{surface},\ \text{orbit})$,
and is \emph{invariantly} expressible as a difference of squared projections.

This shows that the Keplerian total energy is not an isolated Newtonian
artifact but a special case of a deeper geometric structure: the Minkowski--type
projection algebra of WILL Geometry.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Why This Matters]
\begin{itemize}
\item In classical form, the total orbital energy per unit mass depends only on
$GM$ and $a$, and is independent of the test--mass $m$.
\item In WILL form, the same fact is embedded in a Lorentz--like difference
of squared projections, with no need for separate ``gravitational'' and
``kinetic'' constructs.
\item This reframing answers \emph{why} the Keplerian combination appears:
it is enforced by the underlying geometry of energy evolution.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}


\section{Lagrangian and Hamiltonian as Ontologically Corrupted WILL Approximations}

We now demonstrate that the familiar Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms 
are not fundamental principles but ontologically ``dirty'' approximations of 
the relational WILL framework. By collapsing the two-point relational structure 
into a single-point description, classical mechanics gains computational convenience 
at the cost of ontological clarity.

\subsection{Definitions of Parameters}

We consider a central mass $M$ and a test mass $m$. The state of the test 
mass is described in polar coordinates $(r,\phi)$ relative to the central 
mass.

\begin{itemize}
  \item $r_A$ --- reference radius associated with observer $A$ 
  (e.g., planetary surface).
  \item $r_B$ --- orbital radius of the test mass $m$ (position of observer $B$).
  \item $v_B^2 = \dot r_B^2 + r_B^2 \dot\phi^2$ --- total squared orbital speed at $B$.
  \item $\beta_B^2 = v_B^2/c^2$ --- dimensionless kinematic projection at $B$.
  \item $\kappa_A^2 = 2GM/(r_A c^2)$ --- dimensionless potential projection defined at $A$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Relational Lagrangian}

Instead of a relational energy, we define the \emph{clean relational Lagrangian} $L_{\text{rel}}$, which represents the kinetic budget at point $B$ relative to the potential budget at point $A$:
\begin{equation}
L_{\text{rel}} = T(B) - U(A) = \tfrac{1}{2} m\left(\dot r_B^2 + r_B^2 \dot\phi^2\right) - \frac{GMm}{r_A}.
\end{equation}
In dimensionless form, using the rest energy $E_0 = mc^2$, this is:
\begin{equation}
\frac{L_{\text{rel}}}{E_0} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(\beta_B^2 - \kappa_A^2\bigr).
\end{equation}
This two-point, relational form is the clean geometric statement.

\subsection{First Ontological Collapse: The Newtonian Lagrangian}

If one commits the first ontological violation by identifying the two 
distinct points, $r_A = r_B = r$, the relational structure degenerates into a 
local, single-point function:
\begin{equation}
L(r, \dot r, \dot\phi) = \tfrac{1}{2} m\left(\dot r^2 + r^2 \dot\phi^2\right) - \frac{GMm}{r}.
\end{equation}
This is precisely the standard Newtonian Lagrangian. Its origin is not fundamental 
but arises from the collapse of the two-point relational Energy Symmetry law into 
a one-point formalism.

\subsection{Second Ontological Collapse: The Hamiltonian}

Introducing canonical momenta,
\begin{align}
p_r &= \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot r} = m\dot r, \\
p_\phi &= \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot\phi} = mr^2\dot\phi,
\end{align}
one defines the Hamiltonian via the Legendre transformation $H = p_r \dot r + p_\phi \dot\phi - L$. This evaluates to the total energy of the collapsed system:
\begin{equation}
H = T+U = \tfrac{1}{2} m\left(\dot r^2 + r^2 \dot\phi^2\right) + \frac{GMm}{r}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Interpretation}

In terms of the collapsed WILL projections ($\beta^2 = v^2/c^2$ and $\kappa^2 = 2GM/(rc^2)$, both strictly positive), the match to standard mechanics becomes explicit:
\begin{align}
L &= \tfrac{1}{2} m v^2 + \frac{GMm}{r}
   \;\;\;\longleftrightarrow\;\;\;
   \tfrac{1}{2} m c^2\bigl(\beta^2 + \kappa^2\bigr), \\[6pt]
H &= \tfrac{1}{2} m v^2 - \frac{GMm}{r}
   \;\;\;\longleftrightarrow\;\;\;
   \tfrac{1}{2} m c^2\bigl(\beta^2 - \kappa^2\bigr).
\end{align}

Here the ``$+$'' or ``$-$'' signs do not come from $\kappa^2$ itself, which is always positive, but from the ontological collapse of the two-point relational energy law into a single-point formalism. In WILL, both projections are clean and positive; in standard mechanics, the apparent sign difference arises only after this collapse.

Both are ontologically ``dirty''  approximations. The clean relational law, 
involving distinct points $A$ and $B$, is collapsed into a local, 
one-point description. This shows that  Hamiltonian and  Lagrangian are just needlessly overcomplicated approximations that  lose in ontological integrity.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Key Message]
The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian are not fundamental principles. They are 
degenerate shadows of a deeper relational Energy Symmetry law. Classical mechanics, 
Special Relativity, and General Relativity all operate within this corrupted 
approximation. WILL restores the underlying two-point relational clarity.
\end{tcolorbox}
