\subsection{No Ontological Commitments}

This model makes no ontological claims about the "existence" of space, particles, or fields. Instead, all phenomena are treated as observer-dependent energetic projections.

\subsection{Motivation and Core Principles}

The standard formulation of General Relativity often relies on the concept of an asymptotically flat spacetime, introducing an implicit external reference frame beyond the physical systems under study. While some modern approaches (e.g., shape dynamics) seek greater relationality, we proceed from strict epistemic minimalism, disallowing all background structures, even hidden or asymptotic ones.

\textbf{Principle:} \emph{All physical quantities must be defined purely by their relations.} Any introduction of absolute properties or external frames risks reintroducing metaphysical artifacts and contradicts the foundational insight of relativity.

\textbf{What is Energy?} Energy is not an intrinsic property of objects, but a measure of difference between possible states. It expresses the system's capacity to transition, always encountered as a relative potential for change—not as something possessed, but as a comparative structure between observers. In this framework, energy marks the tendency for one configuration to transform into another. 

\[
\begin{array}{c} \boxed{ 
\begin{array}{c} 
\text{Energy } \text{ is not an intrinsic property,} \\ 
\text{but a } \textit{measure of difference} \\ 
\text{between possible states. }
\end{array} 
} \end{array}
\]

\section{Single Unifying Postulate}
\vspace{1em}
We therefore posit a single unifying postulate:

\[
\boxed{\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION}}
\]

\textbf{Clarification:} By ``energy evolution'' we mean the total structure of possible transitions between observable states---not a process unfolding in spacetime, but the very relational geometry from which both space and time emerge. This is not a derived result, but a foundational postulate, subject to geometric and empirical audit in subsequent sections. ``WILL'' is used here as a technical term for this unified, emergent structure.

The goal of this framework is not merely to reconstruct the formulas of Special and General Relativity, but to demonstrate that they are the unique and necessary consequences of a single, deeper principle of relational geometry. By showing \textit{why} these specific mathematical structures must arise, the model provides a more fundamental explanation for them than the standard formalisms alone.

\subsection{Fundamental Structure of WILL}

From our postulate, several key properties of the WILL framework can be derived:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Self-contained structure:} Since spacetime is identical to energy evolution, there can be no external objects or reference frames. The WILL framework therefore admits no background container in which energy “sits.” What we call “geometry” here refers not to spatial form, but to the relational configuration space of energy itself. 
    
    \item \textbf{Conservation law:} A closed configuration naturally leads to conservation principles—nothing enters or leaves the system, making the total energy constant.
    
    \item \textbf{Symmetry:} With no external reference, all relations must be equivalent; any asymmetry would require a preferred frame, which is disallowed.
    
    \item \textbf{Circular/spherical configuration:} Among all closed and maximally symmetric manifolds in parameter space, the circle (and, in higher dimensions, the surface of the sphere) uniquely preserves equivalence of all points and directions. These are not spatial objects, but abstract topological constructs encoding the closure of energy relations. Their role is to guarantee that no hidden reference structure or asymmetry contaminates the algebra. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Emergence of Space and Time}
\textit{In this construction, “space’’ and “time’’ are not assumed as pre-existing containers, but arise as complementary projections of the underlying rate and direction of energetic transformation along the closed relational structure.}

The word "evolution" in our postulate implies a non-instantaneous process, requiring a rate of change. This rate naturally establishes a relationship between what we perceive as spatial and temporal units, yielding the speed of evolution.

Any energy state can be represented as a point on the abstract circle. Changes in energy states correspond to movement along this circle, characterized by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Speed of state change (rate of evolution)
    \item Direction of state change
\end{itemize}

These two orthogonal components naturally give rise to what we interpret as space-like and time-like dimensions, without presupposing coordinate axes or external geometry. 

Among closed, orientable, simply-connected manifolds of constant positive curvature,
\begin{itemize}
  \item in 1-D, the circle $S^{1}$ is unique;
  \item in 2-D, the 2-sphere $S^{2}$ is unique.
\end{itemize}
These manifolds are distinguished by having the largest possible isometry group acting transitively, thereby eliminating any preferred directions or cycles. Within WILL they serve not as spatial surfaces but as the only projection arenas consistent with the postulate of energy evolution and its demand for internal symmetry. 
\section{Kinetic Energy}

\subsection{Reinterpretation of speed of light:}

We interpreting the \textbf{speed of light} $\textbf{c}$ as the \textbf{universal rate of change} implying that every energy transformation or interaction has the same rate = c distributed  between spatial like and temporal like components. We expressing \textbf{universal rate of change}\textbf{ c} as rotating radial vector so the unit circle naturally emerges as embodiment of conservation law. This choice is enforced by conservation of the fixed modulus $c$, forcing the endpoint to lie on the unit circle:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{$r=c = 1$} rotating radial vector on a unit circle controlled by:
    \item \textbf{$\theta_S = \arccos(\beta)$} relativistic angle represents energy distribution by rotation of radial vector.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
    \item  \textbf{$ \beta =  \frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{2r}} =  \cos(\theta_S), \quad \text{(Orbital velocity)}$} space like kinetic component ($X$axis) 
\end{itemize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item   $L_c =\sqrt{1-\beta^2} =\sin(\theta_S),\text{ (Length contraction factor)}$ temporal like component  ($Y$axis) 
        \item $T_d =\frac{1}{L_c}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2} }=\frac{1}{\sin(\theta_S)},\text{ (Time dilation factor)}$ identical to relativistic $\gamma$ factor.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[thick] (0,0) circle(1);
\draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (0.8,0) node[midway, below] {$\beta$};
\draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (0.8,0.6) node[above right] {$E$};
\draw[->, thick] (0.8,0) -- (0.8,0.6) node[midway, right] {$\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}$};
\end{tikzpicture}

In our model, the spatial and temporal-like projections are not to be interpreted as traditional coordinates, but as relative geometric ratios derived from the invariant rate of change. 

\subsection{Special Theory of Relativity (Time Dilation Factor)}

The standard time dilation factor in Special Relativity is given by $\beta = \frac{v}{c}$:

\begin{equation}
T_d = \frac{1}{L_c}= \frac{1}{\sin(\arccos(\beta))}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}=\gamma.
\end{equation}
\textbf{Conclusion:} The derived expression is identical to the standard time dilation factor $\gamma$, demonstrating the equivalence.

\subsection{Interpretation of \(\beta\): Spatial Energy Projection}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\beta$ (Beta): The kinetic projection, representing the ratio of an object's velocity to the universal speed of evolution.  \((v/c)\). It quantifies how much of the "speed of change" is perceived as motion through space relative to observer. Not an intrinsic property of an object but rather a measure of the differences between states, perceived from the perspective of an observer.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The range of \(\beta\) is naturally constrained: $0 \leq \beta \leq 1$.
Beyond \(\beta = 1\), the object moves faster than the speed at which causal signals propagate (speed of light in vacuum), and therefore becomes causally disconnected from the observer.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\beta$ quantifies the energy of an object or system as expressed in terms of the relative rate of change of spatial coordinates. Operationally, it reflects the amount of energy the observer would need to expend to "catch up" with the object.
\end{itemize}

\section{Potential Energy}
\subsection{Beyond Curvature: A New Perspective

The value $\kappa = 1$ corresponds precisely to the point where escape velocity equals the speed of light, creating an event horizon. This provides a natural causal limit for our gravitational parameter, analogous to the light-speed causal limit for relative motion.

Equivalent to our previous derivation of $\beta$ as kinetic energy component, now we can derive $\kappa$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  \textbf{$ \kappa =  \frac{v_e}{c} = \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{r}} =  \sin(\theta_G), \quad \text{(Escape velocity)}$}. time like potential component ($Y$axis) 
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{$\theta_G = \arcsin(\kappa)$} gravitational angle represents potential energy distribution.
\end{itemize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item   $T_c =\sqrt{1-\kappa^2}=\sqrt{1-\frac{R_s}{r}}  =\cos(\theta_G)\text{ (Time contraction factor)}$ spatial like component  ($X$axis) 
        \item $L_d =\frac{1}{T_c}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\kappa^2} }=\frac{1}{\cos(\theta_G)}\text{ (Length dilation factor)}$.
    \end{itemize}
where $R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$

\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[thick] (0,0) circle(1);
\draw[-, thick] (0,0.8) -- (0.6,0.8) node[above, right] {$\sqrt{1 - \kappa^2}$};
\draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (0.6,0.8) node[midway, right] {$E$};
\draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (0,0.8) node[midway, left] {$\kappa$};
\end{tikzpicture}

\subsection{General Theory of Relativity (Schwarzschild radial length factor)}
The relevant component of the Schwarzschild metric, related to gravitational length dilation, is given by $\kappa^2 = \frac{R_s}{r}$:
\begin{equation}
L_d = \frac{1}{T_c}=\frac{1}{\cos(\arcsin(\kappa))}= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \kappa^2}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{R_s}{r}}}.
\end{equation}
\textbf{Conclusion:} The derived expression is identical to the relevant component of the Schwarzschild metric, demonstrating the equivalence.
 

\section{Fundamental Relation Between Potential and Kinetic Energy Projections}

\subsection{The Topological Necessity of \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) Projections}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title= \textbf{Important clarification:}]
These are not spatial objects, but abstract topological constructs encoding the conservation law and closure of energy relations. 
\end{tcolorbox}

The postulate \(\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION}\) is not a vague metaphor but a precise geometric constraint. It demands that all physical quantities emerge from the relational structure of transitions between observable states. This structure must be:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Self-contained:} There is no external background.
    \item \textbf{Conservative:} The total "resource" for evolution is fixed.
    \item \textbf{Maximally Symmetric:} No point or direction is privileged.
\end{enumerate}

These are not additional assumptions; they are the \textit{operational definitions} of what it means for spacetime to be identical to energy evolution. Any geometry violating these principles would reintroduce an absolute background, violating the postulate.

The fundamental question is: \textit{What are the unique geometric arenas that can host such a complete description of physical evolution?}

We must now characterize the types of "energy evolution" that constitute physics. There are two, and only two, fundamental classes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Class I (Directional Evolution):} This describes a transition whose character is defined by a \textit{preferred axis}. The act of measurement is the act of distinguishing this axis (e.g., the line connecting observer and object for relative velocity). The energy measure is inherently tied to a specific direction. This is the domain of kinematics.
    \item \textbf{Class II (Omnidirectional Evolution):} This describes a transition whose character is \textit{inherently without a preferred axis}. The act of measurement is the act of establishing a relation to a center, but the resulting field is defined equally in all directions from that center. This is the domain of a static, central potential.
\end{itemize}

These are not arbitrary choices. They are an exhaustive catalogue of the fundamental relational categories implied by the postulate. Class I isolates a single degree of freedom for measurement. Class II encompasses the full set of directional possibilities from a point.

The geometry must now accommodate these classes while obeying the three constraints above.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{For Class I (Directional):} The only closed, 1-dimensional manifold of constant positive curvature is the circle, \(S^1\). It is unique. It is maximally symmetric (all points and rotations are equivalent). It is self-contained and embodies conservation (the fixed radius). \textbf{Therefore, the kinematic parameter \(\beta\) must be a projection on \(S^1\). There is no other option.}
    \item \textbf{For Class II (Omnidirectional):} The only closed, simply-connected 2-dimensional manifold of constant positive curvature is the sphere, \(S^2\). It is unique. It is maximally symmetric (all points and rotational axes are equivalent). It is self-contained. \textbf{Therefore, the gravitational parameter \(\kappa\) must be a projection on \(S^2\). There is no other option.}
\end{itemize}

Closed, self-contained universe requires that the "total space of possibilities" for each projection mode be complete. The fundamental, dimensionless measure for the completeness of these geometries is their full angle:

\begin{itemize}
    \item For the circle ($S^1$), the total available "configurational space" is the full \textbf{planar angle}, measured as $2\pi$ \textbf{radians}.
    \item For the sphere ($S^2$), the total available "configurational space" is the full \textbf{solid angle}, measured as $4\pi$ \textbf{steradians}.
\end{itemize}

The ratio of the total angular measures of these two fundamental manifolds is a pure, dimensionless number dictated by their intrinsic topology:
\[
\frac{\text{Total Solid Angle (Sphere)}}{\text{Total Planar Angle (Circle)}} = \frac{4\pi \text{ sr}}{2\pi \text{ rad}} = 2
\]
This factor of 2 is a direct and necessary consequence of the dimensional difference between an omnidirectional (2D) and a linear (1D) projection space.

\begin{quote}\small
Here both $2\pi$ and $4\pi$ are the \emph{complete normalized angular measures} of $S^1$ and $S^2$. 
\textbf{Not spatial objects, but abstract topological constructs.}
Although planar and solid angles are defined in different dimensional settings, 
both are formally dimensionless in SI and serve as the natural measures of their respective closed symmetric manifolds. 
Thus their ratio is a pure number, reflecting the intrinsic topological difference between one- and two-dimensional projection spaces.
\end{quote}

\subsection{The Quadratic Nature of Energetic Projections}

To translate this purely geometric ratio into a physical law, we must consider how projections relate to energy. In physics, the energetic significance (or "power") of a field, velocity, or wave is proportional not to its amplitude, but to its \textbf{amplitude squared}. This quadratic relationship is fundamental, appearing in kinetic energy ($E_k \propto v^2$), potential energy in fields, and the energy density of electromagnetic waves ($E \propto A^2$).

Furthermore, in any projectional geometry, the magnitudes of orthogonal components are related to the whole via a Pythagorean sum of squares. Therefore, the conserved evolution resource is distributed among the squares of its projections. The fundamental relation must connect the ratio of the \textit{energetic significances} of the modes ($\kappa^2$ and $\beta^2$) to the underlying topological ratio of their geometric arenas.

This leads to the unique and necessary unification equation:
\[
\frac{\kappa^2}{\beta^2} = 2 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \boxed{\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2}
\]

\paragraph{Important Clarification.}
This factor of 2 is not an empirical constant, a Newtonian mechanical result, or a coincidence of orbital dynamics. It is a direct consequence of the ratio of the fundamental angular measures (steradians to radians) that define the complete projection spaces for omnidirectional and linear phenomena.

\subsection{Geometric Relationships}

The relativistic and gravitational factors can be expressed in unified algebraic and trigonometric forms, as shown in Table 1.

\begin{table}[h]

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\(\theta_S = \arccos(\beta),\quad \theta_G = \arcsin(\kappa)\)}\\

\end{tabular}
\caption{Unified representation of relativistic and gravitational effects.}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{The Combined Energy Parameter $Q$}

The total energy projection parameter unifies both aspects:

\begin{align}
    Q &=\sqrt{\kappa^2 + \beta^2}  \\
    Q^{2}&= 3\beta^2 = \frac{3}{2}\kappa^2 = \frac{3R_s}{2r_{d}} \\
    Q_t &= \sqrt{1-Q^2} = \sqrt{1-\kappa^2-\beta^2} = \sqrt{1-3\beta^2} = \sqrt{1-\frac{3}{2}\kappa^2} \\
    Q_r &= \frac{1}{Q_t}
\end{align}

These describe the combined effects of relativity and gravity.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Unified Interpretation]
The familiar SR and GR factors emerge here as projections of the same conserved geometry. 
Relativistic ($\beta$) and gravitational ($\kappa$) modes are not separate “effects” but dual aspects of one energy-evolution constraint revealing their unified origin.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Energy–Symmetry Law}\label{sec:energy-symmetry}

\subsection{Causal Continuity and Energy Symmetry}
\begin{theorem}[Energy Symmetry]
The energy differences perceived by two observers at different positions balance according to the Energy–Symmetry Law:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Consider two observers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Observer $A$ at rest on the surface at radius $r_A$.
\item Observer $B$ orbiting at radius $r_B > r_A$ with orbital velocity $v_B$.
\end{itemize}
Each observer perceives energy transfers differently due to gravitational and kinetic differences:
From $A$'s perspective (surface → orbit):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Object gains potential energy by moving away from gravitational center.
\item Object gains kinetic energy by accelerating to orbital velocity.
\end{enumerate}
This results in energy difference:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\Delta E_{A \to B} = \frac{1}{2}\left((\kappa_A^2 - \kappa_B^2) + \beta_B^2\right)}
\end{equation}
From $B$'s perspective (orbit → surface):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Object loses gravitational potential energy descending into stronger gravitational field.
\item Object loses kinetic energy by reducing velocity from orbital speed to rest.
\end{enumerate}
This results in energy difference:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\Delta E_{B \to A} = \frac{1}{2}\left((\kappa_B^2 - \kappa_A^2) - \beta_B^2\right)}
\end{equation}
Summing these transfers:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0
\end{equation}
Thus, no net energy is created or destroyed, confirming the Energy–Symmetry Law.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Observer-Agnostic Symmetry}
\begin{theorem}[Observer-Agnostic Energy Symmetry]
The Energy–Symmetry Law holds true independent of the specific model of gravitational or kinetic energy:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0 \quad \forall f(v)
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Regardless of the chosen energy function $f(v)$ representing kinetic or gravitational energy differences, consistency demands that:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0.
\end{equation}
The crucial point is mutual consistency, not specific energy definitions.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Physical Meaning of Factor $\frac{1}{2}$}

The factor $\frac{1}{2}$ does not originate from classical mechanics, but from the geometric nature of the quadratic form that measures the ``evolution budget'' $Q^2 = \kappa^2 + \beta^2$. 

When comparing two nearby states, the change in this quadratic form is
\[
\delta Q^2 = (\kappa_2^2 - \kappa_1^2) + (\beta_2^2 - \beta_1^2).
\]
In energetic terms, only \emph{half} of this variation is attributed to the ``active'' transfer in one direction, because the other half belongs to the reciprocal change seen from the opposite frame. This division is the same geometric reason why kinetic energy in classical mechanics is $K = \frac12 m v^2$: the quadratic metric is naturally paired with a factor $\frac12$ when representing stored or exchanged energy.

Thus:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gravitational potential term: $U \propto -\frac{1}{2}\kappa^2$.
\item Kinetic term: $K \propto \frac{1}{2}\beta^2$.
\end{itemize}
The $\frac12$ reflects the symmetric partition of a quadratic budget between mutually consistent perspectives, not an externally imposed convention.

\subsection{Universal Speed Limit as Consequence of Energy Symmetry}
\begin{theorem}[Universal Speed Limit]
The universal speed limit ($v \leq c$) emerges naturally from Energy–Symmetry conditions.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Assume an object could exceed the speed of light ($\beta > 1$). In that scenario:
\begin{itemize}
\item The kinetic component ($\beta^2$) surpasses unity excessively, causing an irreversible imbalance in energy transfer.
\item No reciprocal transfer could balance this energy, breaking the fundamental symmetry:
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} \neq 0
\end{equation}
Thus, $\beta \leq 1$ ($v \leq c$) is required intrinsically to preserve causal and energetic consistency.
\end{proof}
In essence, WILL Geometry encodes the principle that:
\begin{quote}
The speed of light is the boundary beyond which the energetic symmetry between perspectives breaks down. Causality is not an external rule but a built-in feature of the universe's energetic geometry.
\end{quote}

\section{Classical Keplerian Energy as a WILL--Minkowski Projection}

A striking consequence of the Energy--Symmetry Law is that, when the
zero of gravitational potential is chosen on the surface of the central body
rather than at infinity, the total specific orbital energy (potential $+$ kinetic,
per unit mass) naturally appears in \emph{Minkowski form}.

\subsection{Classical Result with Surface Reference}

For a test body of mass $m$ on a circular orbit of radius $a$ about
a central mass $M_\oplus$ (Earth in our example),
classical Newtonian mechanics gives:
\begin{align}
\Delta U &= -\frac{GM_\oplus m}{a} + \frac{GM_\oplus m}{R_\oplus},\\
K &= \frac12 m\frac{GM_\oplus}{a}.
\end{align}
Adding these and dividing by the rest--energy $E_0 = m c^2$ yields
the dimensionless total:
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{\text{tot}}}{E_0}
= \frac{GM_\oplus}{R_\oplus c^2}
 - \frac12\frac{GM_\oplus}{a c^2}.
\label{eq:classical_surface}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Projection Parameters and Minkowski Form}

Define the WILL projection parameters for the surface and the orbit:
\begin{align}
\kappa_\oplus^2 &\equiv \frac{2GM_\oplus}{R_\oplus c^2},\\
\beta_{\text{orbit}}^2 &\equiv \frac{GM_\oplus}{a c^2}.
\end{align}
Substituting into \eqref{eq:classical_surface} gives the exact identity:
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{\text{tot}}}{E_0}
= \frac12\bigl(\kappa_\oplus^2 - \beta_{\text{orbit}}^2\bigr).
\label{eq:will_minkowski_energy}
\end{equation}

This is already in the form of a \emph{hyperbolic difference of squares}:
if we set $x \equiv \kappa_\oplus$ and $y \equiv \beta_{\text{orbit}}$, then
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{\text{tot}}}{E_0} = \frac12\,(x^2 - y^2),
\end{equation}
which is structurally identical to a Minkowski interval in $(1+1)$ dimensions,
up to the constant factor $\frac12$.

\subsection{Physical Interpretation}

In classical derivations, \eqref{eq:classical_surface} is just the sum
$\Delta U + K$ with a particular choice of potential zero.
In the WILL framework, \eqref{eq:will_minkowski_energy} emerges directly from the
energy--symmetry relation:
\[
\Delta E_{A\to B}
= \frac12\bigl((\kappa_A^2 - \kappa_B^2) + \beta_B^2\bigr),
\]
with $(A,B) = (\text{surface},\ \text{orbit})$,
and is \emph{invariantly} expressible as a difference of squared projections.

This shows that the Keplerian total energy is not an isolated Newtonian
artifact but a special case of a deeper geometric structure: the Minkowski--type
projection algebra of WILL Geometry.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Why This Matters]
\begin{itemize}
\item In classical form, the total orbital energy per unit mass depends only on
$GM$ and $a$, and is independent of the test--mass $m$.
\item In WILL form, the same fact is embedded in a Lorentz--like difference
of squared projections, with no need for separate ``gravitational'' and
``kinetic'' constructs.
\item This reframing answers \emph{why} the Keplerian combination appears:
it is enforced by the underlying geometry of energy evolution.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Key Insight]
\textbf{In Will Geometry, no metric is required.}
All cosmological quantities follow directly from a single scale parameter and geometric energy projection parameter: \( \kappa \).
\end{tcolorbox}

No postulated spacetime manifold.  
No evolving scale factor.  
No tensor fields.  
No metric signatures.

\begin{equation}
\boxed{
\text{Cosmology emerges from geometry of energy projection — not from geometry of space.}
}
\end{equation}


\subsection{Deriving the Cosmological Relation $\kappa^2 = \Omega$}

In this section, we derive the relationship between the geometric energy parameter $\kappa$ and the ratio of the actual energy density of the Universe $\rho$ to the critical density $\rho_{max}$. This leads to the expression $\kappa^2 = \Omega$, where $\Omega$ is the dimensionless density parameter commonly used in cosmology.

We begin by considering the general formula for $\kappa$, derived from energy geometry:

\begin{equation}
\kappa = \sqrt{\frac{2 G M_U}{r_H c^2}}
\end{equation}

Here, $M_U$ is the total mass-energy content within the observable Universe, and $r_H$ is the Hubble radius, defined as:

\begin{equation}
r_H = \frac{c}{H_0}
\end{equation}

To express $M_U$ in terms of the average energy density $\rho_0$, we use the standard formula for the mass within a sphere of radius $r_H$:

\begin{equation}
M_U = 4 \pi r_H^3 \rho
\end{equation}

Substituting into the expression for $\kappa$ gives:

\begin{align}
\kappa &= \sqrt{\frac{2 G}{r_H c^2} \cdot \left( 4 \pi r_H^3 \rho \right)} \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{8 \pi G}{ c^2} \cdot r_H^2 \cdot \rho}
\end{align}

We now insert the definition of the critical density $\rho_c$:

\begin{equation}
\rho_{max} = \frac{H_0^2}{8 \pi G}
\end{equation}

We also recall that $r_H = \frac{c}{H_0}$, so $r_H^2 = \frac{c^2}{H_0^2}$.

Substituting into the previous expression:

\begin{align}
\kappa &= \sqrt{ \frac{8 \pi G}{ c^2} \cdot \frac{c^2}{H_0^2} \cdot \rho } 
= \sqrt{ \frac{8 \pi G}{ H_0^2} \cdot \rho }
\end{align}

Now we invert and substitute the expression for $\rho_{max}$:

\begin{align}
\kappa &= \sqrt{ \frac{\rho}{\rho_{max}} } \,
\Rightarrow \quad \kappa^2 = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{max}}
\end{align}

Finally, recalling that the ratio $\rho / \rho_{max}$ is by definition the cosmological density parameter $\Omega$, we obtain:

\begin{equation}
\boxed{ \kappa^2 = \Omega }
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Clarification on Interpretation}

Although $\Omega = \rho / \rho_{\text{max}}$ is traditionally associated with the spatial flatness of the Universe in the standard cosmological model, the relation $\kappa^2 = \rho / \rho_{\text{max}}$ in the Will Geometry framework does not imply flatness in the metric sense. Instead, it quantifies the degree of energy projection relative to the critical geometric configuration. The concept of "flatness" as used in metric-based cosmology has no direct analog in the non-metric structure of Energy Geometry.

\subsection{Emergence of the Hubble Parameter from Energy Geometry}

In Will Geometry, the Hubble parameter arises not from spacetime expansion, but from a scale-invariant relation between geometric projection parameters. The definition of the characteristic distance and time scale:

\[
r_{d} = \frac{c}{H}, \qquad t_{d} = \frac{1}{H}
\]

leads directly to the expression:

\begin{equation}
\boxed{
H = \frac{c}{r_{\text{d}}} = \frac{1}{t_{\text{d}}}
}
\end{equation}

This expression holds across all scales and energy densities in the model, since both \( r_{d} \) and \( t_{d} \) are defined through the projection parameter \( \kappa \), independently of the specific value of \( H \).

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!75!black,title=Interpretation]
In this framework, the Hubble constant is not a free cosmological parameter — it is a derived geometric ratio between the universal speed of projection \( c \), the characteristic radius of energy distribution \( r_{d} \), and the corresponding projection time \( t_{d} \).
\end{tcolorbox}


\section{Geometric Closure between \(\Lambda,\,H,\,\kappa\) and the Causal Disconnection Scale}

From the Will Geometry prescription the cosmological term is a pure
curvature residue
\[
\boxed{\;\Lambda=\frac{\kappa^{2}}{r_{d}^{2}}\;} .
\tag{1}
\]

\vspace{.5em}
\noindent
The escape–curvature parameter \(\kappa\) is itself related to the
Schwarzschild scale,
\[
\kappa^{2}
=\frac{R_{s}}{r_{d}}
\;\;\Longrightarrow\;\;
R_{s}=\kappa^{2}r_{d} .
\tag{2}
\]

\paragraph{Hubble frequency.}
Using \eqref{2} the Will Geometry Hubble parameter
\[
H=\frac{\kappa^{2}c}{R_{s}}
\tag{3}
\]
reduces identically to the simple inverse‐radius law
\[
\boxed{\,H=\frac{c}{r_{d}}\,}.
\tag{4}
\]
Hence
\(
t_{d}\equiv r_{d}/c = 1/H
\)
as required.

\paragraph{Linking \(\Lambda\) to \(H\).}
Insert \(r_{d}=c/H\) from \eqref{4} into \eqref{1}:
\[
\Lambda
=\frac{\kappa^{2}}{(c/H)^{2}}
=\boxed{\;
\frac{\kappa^{2}H^{2}}{c^{2}}
\;} .
\tag{5}
\]
Equation \eqref{5} is the exact geometric counterpart of the usual
\(\Lambda\text{CDM}\) relation \(\Lambda=3\Omega_\Lambda H^{2}/c^{2}\), with the
identification
\[
\boxed{\;\Omega_\Lambda=\kappa^{2}\;} .
\]

\paragraph{Density form.}
Define the maximal geometric density
\(
\rho_{\max}=c^{2}/(8\pi G\,r_{d}^{2})
\).
Using \eqref{4},
\[
\rho_{\max}=\frac{H^{2}}{8\pi G}\;.
\]
With \(\rho_\Lambda=\Lambda c^{2}/(8\pi G)\) and \eqref{5} we obtain the
closed chain
\[
\rho_\Lambda
=\frac{\kappa^{2}H^{2}}{8\pi G}
=\kappa^{2}\rho_{\max},
\qquad
\Omega_\Lambda=\frac{\rho_\Lambda}{\rho_{\max}}
=\kappa^{2}.
\tag{6}
\]
If \(\kappa^{2}=2/3\) (as demanded by the projection balance $\kappa^{2}+\beta^2=1$ \quad and \quad $\kappa^{2}=2\beta^{2}$),
equations \eqref{5}–\eqref{6} reproduce the observed
\(\Omega_\Lambda\approx0.67\) to within current Planck–level accuracy.

\paragraph{Compact summary.}
All late-time “dark-energy” relations emerge from a single algebraic
identity once the radial scale \(r_{d}\) is specified:
\[
\boxed{\Lambda r_{d}^{2}=\kappa^{2}}
\;\Longleftrightarrow\;
\boxed{\Lambda=\frac{\kappa^{2}H^{2}}{c^{2}}}
\;\Longleftrightarrow\;
\boxed{\rho_\Lambda=\kappa^{2}\rho_{\max}} .
\]
No additional fields, free parameters or metric assumptions are
required.  
\[
\boxed{\text{COSMOS} \equiv \text{LOGOS} \equiv \text{GEOMERY}}
\]

\section{Black Hole Entropy in Will Geometry}

\subsection*{Geometric Origin of Entropy}

In Will Geometry, entropy is not a property of an object or hidden internal state. Instead, it arises from an observer’s inability to maintain full projectional coherence across causal boundaries.

\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Entropy is the measure of the number of unaccounted-for projectional frames.}
}
\]

When all relevant frames of reference and their associated energy projections are included in the analysis, the total energetic difference between all observers cancels out.

A black hole represents a domain of permanent projectional frame loss. Once an observer crosses the event horizon, their energy projection becomes causally inaccessible. The remaining observer can no longer cancel the energetic asymmetry, leading to entropy.

\subsection{Minimal Entropic Unit}

Consider two observers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $A$ (astronomer) falls into the black hole: \( \kappa_A^2 = 1 \)
    \item $C$ (cosmonaut) remains outside: \( \beta_C^2 = 0.5 \)
\end{itemize}

Prior to causal disconnection:
\[
\Delta E_{A \to C} + \Delta E_{C \to A} = 0
\]

After causal disconnection:
\[
S_C =  (\beta_C^2)^2 =  \frac{1}{4}
\]

This defines the fundamental unit of entropy as:
\[
\boxed{\Delta S = \frac{1}{4}}
\]
\[
\boxed{
\textbf{Entropy arises from the permanent loss of projectional frames.}
}
\]

\subsection{Generalization to Horizon Area}

Let the event horizon consist of \( N \) inaccessible projectional frames. Each contributes a unit asymmetry:

\[
S_{\text{EG}} =  \left( \sum_{i=1}^N \Delta E_i \right)^2 =  N \cdot \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)
\]

Using \( N = A / l_P^2 \), we obtain:

\[
S_{\text{EG}} = \frac{A}{4 l_P^2}
\]

\subsection{Comparison with Hawking Entropy}

This matches the standard form:
\[
S_{\text{BH}} = \frac{k_B A}{4 l_P^2}
\]

with the only difference being the inclusion of the Boltzmann constant \( k_B \), which restores physical units.

\subsection{Interpretation and Consequences}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Entropy is zero only when all relevant energetic projections are accounted for.
    \item Positive entropy reflects a deficiency in geometric awareness — a limitation in the observer's ability to reconstruct the full projectional structure.
    \item The \textbf{arrow of time} emerges naturally as a consequence of asymmetric projectional evolution:
    \[
    \text{Time} \equiv \Delta(\kappa, \beta), \quad \text{and} \quad S \propto |\Delta(\kappa, \beta)_{\text{net}}|
    \]
    \item Irreversibility is not an inherent feature of the universe, but a shadow cast by partial projection.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Key Insight]
Entropy is not a function of internal disorder —\\
it is a function of missing frames in the energetic geometry.\\
Causality is preserved when projection is complete.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Zeno-Type Divergence in Black Hole Infall}

\subsection*{Relational Setup}

Consider two bodies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Object} $B$ falling into a black hole
    \item \textbf{Observer} $O_2$ stationed just inside the Schwarzschild radius at $r = R_s$
\end{itemize}

In WILL geometry, we reject absolute coordinates or privileged observers. All quantities are \textit{relational} and must be defined via energetic projections between causal agents.

Let the encounter between $B$ and $O_2$ occur at $r = R_s$. This implies:
\[
\kappa_B^2 = \kappa_{O_2}^2 = 1
\]

As $B$ continues inward, its projectional escape parameter increases:
\[
\kappa_B^2 > 1
\]

The observer $O_2$, remaining at a fixed radial coordinate, retains:
\[
\kappa_{O_2}^2 = 1
\]

This leads to a projectional divergence:
\[
\Delta \kappa^2 = \kappa_B^2 - \kappa_{O_2}^2
\]

\textbf{Projectional placement of $O_2$.}
A material observer cannot hover at a rigid coordinate radius
$r=R_s$ without infinite thrust.
Instead, we characterise $O_2$ purely by its projectional state
$\kappa_{O_2}^{2}=1$ 
and leave the coordinate label open; this avoids introducing
super-luminal stresses while keeping the relational description intact.

\subsection*{Causal Decoupling Condition}

Causal coherence in WILL geometry is maintained only if the energetic divergence remains below a critical threshold:
\[
\boxed{
\Delta \kappa^2 < 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{Coherent Projection Possible}
}
\]

Once:
\[
\boxed{
\Delta \kappa^2 = 1
}
\]
the system reaches the critical point beyond which energetic projection becomes asymmetric and irreversible. This corresponds to a new emergent causal horizon from the observer's point of view.


\textbf{Energetic meaning of the unit threshold.}
The critical value $\Delta\kappa^{2}=1$ is not arbitrary: it is the point where, in the frame of the observer, the local invariant $W_{\text{ill}}=\frac{E\,T^{2}}{M\,L^{2}}$ would soar to \textit{twice} its balanced value, $W_{\text{ill}}^{(O_2)}=2$.
In other words, the projected energy budget and the projected mass–length budget differ by 100\%, breaking the symmetry that normally enforces projectional coherence. Any larger divergence makes reciprocal energetic projection impossible, so a new causal horizon must form.

Solving:
\[
\kappa_B^2 = \kappa_{O_2}^2 + 1 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{R_s}{r} = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \frac{1}{2} R_s
\]

Thus, observer $O_2$ perceives a secondary horizon forming at:
\[
\boxed{r = \frac{1}{2} R_s}
\]


\textbf{Observer-dependence.}
The surface at $r=\frac{1}{2}R_s$ is \emph{not} a universal, metric horizon; it is a horizon for the specific pair $(O_2,B)$. A differently situated agent would in general construct a different inner boundary. Hence these "second horizons" are projectional and observer-dependent, not new absolute structures.


\subsection*{Switching to the Black Hole Surface Frame}

Let us now reformulate the scenario in the projectional system formed by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The falling object $B$
    \item The black hole surface $H$
\end{itemize}

At the initial reference radius $r = R_s$, let the projectional velocity of the object be:
\[
\beta_B = \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{2R_s}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.707
\]

According to WILL geometry, velocity scales as:
\[
\beta^2 = \frac{R_s}{2r}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\boxed{r = \frac{R_s}{2\beta^2}}
\]

Then, the relative projectional velocity between the surface $H$ and the object $B$ becomes:
\[
\Delta \beta = \beta_B - \beta_H
\]

Let us find the radius where this difference reaches unity:
\[
\beta_B - \beta_H = 1
\]

Assuming the surface is initially stationary in its own frame, $\beta_H = 0$, then:
\[
\beta_B = 1 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \frac{R_s}{2r} = 1 \quad\Rightarrow\quad r = \frac{1}{2} R_s
\]


\textbf{Relative, not local, velocity.}
Throughout this section, $\beta$ is a \emph{projectional} (observer-dependent) velocity parameter. Even inside the classical Schwarzschild horizon each infalling body is locally sub-luminal in its proper frame; what reaches $\beta=1$ here is the \emph{relative} projection between the object and the chosen reference surface $H$.


\textbf{Result:}  
The relative velocity between black hole surface and falling object reaches the speed of light at:
\[
\boxed{r = \frac{1}{2} R_s}
\]

This matches the location of the second causal horizon derived from the $O_2$ frame, confirming the symmetry and invariance of the horizon structure under change of observer.

\subsection*{Zeno-Type Causal Cascade}

This logic can be repeated recursively:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduce a new observer $O_3$ just below the new horizon at $r = \frac{1}{2} R_s$
    \item The same divergence occurs as $B$ continues inward
    \item A third horizon appears at $r = \frac{1}{4} R_s$
    \item And so on... until $r_{n}\sim l_P$
\end{itemize}

This generates an infinite causal chain of projectional disconnections:
\[
r_n = \frac{R_s}{2^n}
\quad\text{for } n \in \mathbb{N}
\]


\textbf{Planck cut-off.}
The recursion must terminate once $r_n \lesssim l_P$, because below the Planck scale the smooth projectional manifold is no longer meaningful. The series is therefore finite in physical practice, avoiding an actual Zeno divergence. (this is an assumption based on Standard model, it needs to be tested)


\subsection{Layered Holographic Ledger}

We now marry the projectional Zeno cascade to the WILL holographic principle. Each surface in the cascade is
\[
\boxed{r_n = \frac{R_s}{2^{n}},\qquad\kappa_n^{2}=1}
\]

and carries area $A_n = 4\pi r_n^{2}=A_0\,4^{-n}$ with $A_0=4\pi R_s^{2}$.
Following the WILL derivation of black-hole entropy, the entropy on $\Sigma_n$ is
\[
S_n = \frac{A_n}{4\,l_P^{2}},\qquad
\Delta S_n = S_{n-1}-S_{n}=\frac{3}{4}\,S_{n-1},
\]

so the series $\{\Delta S_n\}$ is geometric and sums exactly to the outer-surface entropy $S_0$.
After $N\simeq\log_2(R_s/l_P)$ steps the innermost layer reaches $r_N\approx l_P$ and $S_N\approx 1$, ending the cascade.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!3, colframe=black!65, title=Layered Holographic Ledger]
The Zeno cascade realises a finite, Planck-terminated stack of balanced surfaces $\{\Sigma_0,\Sigma_1,\ldots,\Sigma_N\}$.
Each shell stores $\Delta S_n=\frac{3}{4}\,S_{n-1}$ bits, so the complete ledger retains exactly $S_0=A_0/(4l_P^{2})$ bits.
No information is lost—only redistributed across nested projectional layers.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Geometric Interpretation}

This recursive disconnection mirrors Zeno's paradox: no matter how close the object $B$ comes to the center, there is always a smaller horizon that forms ahead of it in the observer's projectional frame.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Zeno-Type Causal Structure]
The object $B$ never reaches a final projectional destination — every step forward inwards generates a new boundary of causal coherence. The internal structure of a black hole becomes a nested hierarchy of disjoint causal manifolds.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{Resolution in WILL Geometry}

The paradox dissolves when adopting a fully relational model:
\begin{itemize}
    \item There is no absolute "center" or "final location" for $B$
    \item Each causal horizon marks a transition to a new projectional domain
    \item The manifold is not singular, but hierarchically nested
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conclusion:}  
Black hole interiors in WILL Geometry consist of sequences of projectionally separated causal layers — each inaccessible from the last once the energy symmetry breaks. The fall is not toward a point, but into a structured cascade of coherence domains.


\section{Dark Energy as Accumulated Projectional Loss}

\subsection{Energy Symmetry and Frame Loss}

In Part I, we established the fundamental Energy Symmetry Law:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{external}=\Delta E_{A \to C} + \Delta E_{C \to A} = 0
\end{equation}

This law ensures energetic balance between observers through reciprocal energy projections. However, causal disconnection—such as matter falling beyond event horizons - breaks this symmetry.

\subsection{The Unified Energy Parameter}

The complete energetic structure of any system is captured by the unified parameter:
\begin{equation}
Q^2 = \kappa^2 + \beta^2 = 3\beta^2
\end{equation}

Using the fundamental relation $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$, we obtain:
\begin{align}
Q^2 &= 3\beta^2 = \frac{3}{2}\kappa^2 \\
Q^2 - \kappa^2 &= \beta^2 \quad \text{(kinematic component)} \\
Q^2 - \beta^2 &= \kappa^2 \quad \text{(potential component)}
\end{align}

\subsection{Mechanism of Projectional Loss}

When an observer falls beyond a causal horizon:
\begin{itemize}
\item The external observer retains access only to $\beta^2$
\item The corresponding $\kappa^2$ projection becomes inaccessible
\item Energy Symmetry Law cannot be restored: $\Delta E_{external} \neq 0$
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!70!black, title=Cosmological Imbalance]
\textbf{Dark energy emerges as the cumulative effect of lost $\kappa^2$ projections across all cosmological horizons.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Cosmological Energy Fractions}

From the unified parameter structure, the cosmic energy fractions become:

\begin{align}
\Omega_m &= \frac{\beta^2}{Q^2} = \frac{\beta^2}{3\beta^2} = \frac{1}{3} \\
\Omega_\Lambda &= \frac{\kappa^2}{Q^2} = \frac{2\beta^2}{3\beta^2} = \frac{2}{3}
\end{align}

These ratios are **not empirical fits** but geometric necessities arising from the asymmetric loss of projectional frames.

\subsection{Geometric Resonance at $\kappa^2 = 2/3$}

The cosmological prediction $\kappa^2 = 2/3$ corresponds to the critical geometric configuration where:
\begin{equation}
\kappa^2 + \beta^2 = 1
\end{equation}

This occurs at the photon sphere radius $r = 1.5R_s$, where:
\begin{equation}
\theta_S = \theta_G \approx 54.74°
\end{equation}

At this critical angle, energy projections satisfy:
\begin{equation}
\beta = T_c, \quad \kappa = L_c
\end{equation}

The Universe operates at the boundary of causal coherence—balanced on the edge of projectional accessibility.

\subsection{The Cosmological Constant}

The cosmological constant emerges as:
\begin{equation}
\Lambda = \frac{\kappa^2}{r_d^2} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{r_d^2}
\end{equation}

where $r_d = c/H_0$ is the Hubble radius. This yields:
\begin{equation}
\rho_\Lambda = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \rho_{max}
\end{equation}

This exactly reproduces the observed cosmological ratio:
\[
\boxed{
\Omega_\Lambda = \frac{2}{3}, \quad \Omega_m = \frac{1}{3}
}
\]


\subsection{Interpretation}

The Universe operates in a geometric configuration equivalent to the boundary of photon capture. Not a black hole, but a projectional analog: a horizon of causal coherence. The cosmological constant is not mysterious — it is the global projection of this curvature limit.

\textbf{
\(\Lambda\) is the curvature at which information is still marginally projectable.\\
It is the frequency of coherence at the edge of universal causal  disconnection.
}
\end{tcolorbox}

Dark energy is not a mysterious substance but the geometric shadow of energetic incompleteness:

\begin{itemize}
\item It reflects the loss of internal symmetry across cosmic horizons
\item It does not drive expansion - it compensates for broken energy balance
\item It emerges wherever projectional frames become causally inaccessible
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}[On ``local'' vs.~``global'']
In the WILL framework the usual distinction between ``local'' and ``global''
loses its meaning. Without any background manifold there is no external stage
on which to separate neighborhood properties from topological ones.
Quantities such as
\[
\Lambda(r) = \frac{\kappa^2}{r^2}
\]
are neither ``local'' nor ``global'' in the conventional sense, but emerge
directly as structural consequences of the relational principle. The notion
of scale $r$ is itself relational, not a coordinate distance, and thus no
additional normalization factors (such as the familiar ``3'' from FRW
cosmology) appear.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Conclusion}

The critical value \(\kappa^2 = 2/3\) is not an observational coincidence — it is a universal resonance point in the geometry of projection. Lambda is its expression in cosmological scale.

\textit{
The Universe lives balanced on the photon sphere of its own projection.

$\boxed{
\text{Balance is not imposed — it is what exists.}

$\boxed{
\text{The Universe simply is the extremum.}

\subsection{Energy Symmetry Validation: GPS Satellite and Earth}

\begin{theorem}[Real-World Energy Symmetry]
The Energy Symmetry Law holds precisely for the Earth-GPS satellite system.
 WILL-invariant ($W_{\text{ill}} = 1$) holds exactly for the Earth–GPS satellite system.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We verify the Energy Symmetry Law on real orbital data for a GPS satellite and an observer on the Earth's surface, using the following parameters:

\textbf{ Input Data}
\begin{itemize}
\item Gravitational constant: $G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11}$ m$^3$/kg/s$^2$
\item Speed of light: $c = 2.99792458 \times 10^8$ m/s
\item Mass of Earth: $M_{Earth} = 5.972 \times 10^{24}$ kg
\item Radius of Earth: $R_{Earth} = 6.370 \times 10^6$ m
\item Radius of GPS orbit: $r_{GPS} = 2.6571 \times 10^7$ m
\item Seconds in 24 hours $D_{aySeconds} =86400 \quad  \text{s}$
\item Nanoseconds in 1 second $N_{ano}=10^6  \quad \mu\text{ s}$
\end{itemize}

The orbital velocity of the GPS satellite is:
\begin{align}
v_{GPS} &= \sqrt{\frac{GM_{Earth}}{r_{GPS}}} 
= \sqrt{\frac{6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \times 5.972 \times 10^{24}}{2.6571 \times 10^7}} 
= 3873.10090455 \text{ m/s}
\end{align}

Converting to dimensionless parameters:
\begin{align}
\beta_{GPS} &= \frac{v_{GPS}}{c} = \frac{3873.10090455}{2.99792458 \times 10^8} =0.0000129192739884 \\
\kappa_{GPS} &= \sqrt{\frac{2GM_{Earth}}{c^2 r_{GPS}}} =0.0000182706124904 \\
\frac{\kappa_{GPS}^{2}}{\beta_{GPS}^{2}} &=\frac{3.3381528077\times10^{-10}}{1.6690764039\times10^{-10}}=2 \\
Q_{GPS} &=\sqrt{\beta_{GPS}^{2}\ +\kappa_{GPS}^{2}}=0.0000223768389448 \\
Q_{tGPS} &=\sqrt{1-Q_{GPS}^{2}}=\sqrt{1-3\beta_{GPS}^{2}}=0.99999999975
\end{align}
For the Earth's surface:
\begin{align}
\kappa_{Earth} &= \sqrt{\frac{2GM_{Earth}}{c^2 R_{Earth}}} = 0.000037312405944\\
\beta_{Earth} &= 0 \text{ (at rest)} \\
Q_{Earth} &=\sqrt{\beta_{Earth}^{2}\ +\kappa_{Earth}^{2}}=0.000037312405944 \\
Q_{tEarth} &=\sqrt{1-Q_{Earth}^{2}}=0.999999999304
\end{align}
The daily relativistic time offset between GPS and Earth is:
\[
\Delta Q_{t,{\rm GPS} \rightarrow {\rm Earth}} = (Q_{t,{\rm GPS}} - Q_{t,{\rm Earth}}) \cdot 86400 \cdot 10^6 = 38.52~\mu\text{s/day}
\]
This \textbf{matches the empirical time correction required} for GPS synchronization  to high precision.

\subsubsection{WILL invariant validation:}

$W_{ILLGPS}$ parameters of mass energy time and space:
\begin{align*}

M_{GPS} &= T_{dGPS} \beta_{GPS}^2 c^2 \frac{r_{GPS}}{G} \\

E_{GPS} &= L_{dGPS} \frac{\kappa_{GPS}^2 c^4 r_{GPS}}{2G} \\

T_{GPS} &= T_{cGPS} \left(\frac{2GM_{Earth}}{\kappa_{GPS}^2 c^3}\right)^2 \\

L_{GPS} &= L_{cGPS} \left(\frac{GM_{Earth}}{\beta_{GPS}^2 c^2}\right)^2

\end{align*}
Where:
\begin{align*}

L_{cGPS} &= \sqrt{1-\beta_{GPS}^2} \\

T_{dGPS} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta_{GPS}^2}} \\

L_{dGPS} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\kappa_{GPS}^2}} \\

T_{cGPS} &= \sqrt{1-\kappa_{GPS}^2}

\end{align*}
The explicit $W_{ILL}=ET^2 / ML^2=1$ - invariant for the GPS–Earth system, including both GR and SR effects, is:  $$W_{ILLGPS}=\frac{E_{GPS} \cdot T_{GPS}}{M_{GPS} \cdot L_{GPS}} = \frac{
   L_{dGPS}\frac{\kappa_{\rm GPS}^{2} c^{4} r_{\rm GPS}}{2G}
    \cdot T_{cGPS} \left(\frac{2 G M_{\rm Earth}}{\kappa_{\rm GPS}^{2} c^{3}}\right)^{2}
}{
    T_{dGPS}\frac{\beta_{\rm GPS}^{2} c^{2} r_{\rm GPS}}{G}
    \cdot L_{cGPS} \left(\frac{G M_{\rm Earth}}{\beta_{\rm GPS}^{2} c^{2}}\right)^{2}
} = 1$$

All physical quantities cancel identically, leaving $L_{dGPS} T_{cGPS} = T_{dGPS} L_{cGPS}$, which is satisfied by geometric construction.

\subsubsection{Energy Symmetry Law validation:}

The energy difference from Earth observer to GPS satellite is:
\begin{align}
\Delta E_{Earth \rightarrow GPS} &= \frac{1}{2}((\kappa^2_{Earth} - \kappa^2_{GPS}) + \beta^2_{GPS})
= 6.1265399845\times10^{-10}
\end{align}

The energy difference from GPS satellite to Earth is:
\begin{align}
\Delta E_{GPS \rightarrow Earth} &= \frac{1}{2}( (\kappa^2_{GPS} - \kappa^2_{Earth}) - \beta^2_{GPS}) = -6.1265399845\times10^{-10}
\end{align}
Therefore:
\begin{align}
\Delta E_{GPS \rightarrow Earth}+\Delta E_{Earth \rightarrow GPS}  = -6.1265399845\times10^{-10} + 6.1265399845\times10^{-10} = 0
\end{align}

This \textbf{confirms the Energy Symmetry Law} to machine precision using real-world orbital and physical data.

And lets also compare the results with real total energy. We will take aproximate mass of GPS satellite:

\[
m_{sat}=600 \quad kg
\]

Classical potential energy   $E_{pGPS}=(-\frac{GM_{Earth}m_{sat}}{r_{GPS}})-(-\frac{GM_{Earth}m_{sat}}{R_{Earth}})$

Classical kinetic energy     $E_{kGPS}=\frac{1}{2}m_{sat}\ v_{GPS}^{2}$

Classical total energy   $E_{tot}=E_{pGPS}+E_{kGPS} = 3.3043450143\times10^{10}  \quad    kg   (m^2
/ s^2)$

\textbf{Conformation of nontriviality of Energy Symmetry Law.} 
\[
\frac{\frac{E_{tot}}{m_{sat}c^{2}}}{\Delta E_{Earth \rightarrow GPS} } = 1
\]

Remarkably, satellite mass $m_{sat}$ does not appear anywhere in the computation of the geometric energy $\Delta E_{Earth \rightarrow GPS}$. Yet, when the total physical energy $E_{tot}$ (the sum of kinetic and potential energies, which does depend on $m_{sat}$ is normalized by the satellite’s rest energy $E_{0GPS} = m_{sat} c^2$ the ratio exactly matches the unitless geometric value as shown above. This confirms that $\Delta E_{Earth \rightarrow GPS}$ precisely encodes the relationship between the system’s real energy and the satellite’s own rest energy, entirely independent of its absolute mass.
In other words, the geometric projection captures the physical “share” of energy—purely as a relational quantity—regardless of the object's individual mass.

\textbf{Physical Logic:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All gravitational and velocity (SR+GR) effects are simple projections, not metric-dependent.
    \item No tensors, no differentials, no explicit metric.
    \item The universe’s “time flow” at each location is just a geometric combination of energy projections.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\emph{“Time does not drive change — instead, change defines time.”}
\end{center}

\end{proof}

\subsection{Relativistic Precession Validation: Mercury and the Sun}

\begin{theorem}[Relativistic Precession Calculation via WILL Geometry]
The relativistic precession of Mercury's orbit matches the classical GR result with high precision, using WILL Geometry projection parameters.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We verify the precession of Mercury's orbit using WILL Geometry and compare it to the GR prediction.

\textbf{Input physical parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Gravitational constant: $G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11}$ m$^3$/kg/s$^2$
\item Speed of light: $c = 2.99792458 \times 10^8$ m/s
\item Mass of the Sun: $M_{\text{Sun}} = 1.98847 \times 10^{30}$ kg
\item Schwarzschild radius of the Sun: $R_{Ssun} = 2.953$ km = $2953$ m
\item Semi-major axis of Mercury: $a_{Merc} = 5.79 \times 10^{10}$ m
\item Eccentricity of Mercury's orbit: $e_{Merc} = 0.2056$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Dimensionless projection parameters for Mercury:}
\begin{align}
\kappa_{Merc} &= \sqrt{\frac{R_{Ssun}}{a_{Merc}}} = \sqrt{\frac{2953}{5.79 \times 10^{10}}} = 0.000225878693163 \\
\beta_{Merc} &= \sqrt{\frac{R_{Ssun}}{2 a_{Merc}}} = \sqrt{\frac{2953}{2 \times 5.79 \times 10^{10}}} = 0.000159720355661
\end{align}

\textbf{Combined energy projection parameter:}
\[
Q_{Merc}=\sqrt{\kappa_{Merc}^{2}+\beta_{Merc}^{2}}=0.000276643771008
\]
\begin{align}
Q_{Merc}^{2} &= 3 \beta_{Merc}^{2} = 3 \times (0.000159720355661)^2 = 7.6531776038 \times 10^{-8}
\end{align}

\textbf{Correction factor for the elliptic orbit divided by 1 orbital period:}
\begin{align}
\frac{1 - e_{Merc}^{2}}{2\pi} &= \frac{1 - (0.2056)^2}{2 \times 3.14159265359} = \frac{0.9577}{6.28318530718} = 0.152427247197
\end{align}

\textbf{Final WILL Geometry precession result:}
\begin{align}
M_{PWILL} &= \frac{3 \beta_{Merc}^{2}}{\frac{1 - e_{Merc}^{2}}{2\pi}} = \frac{2\pi Q_{Merc}^{2}}{\left(1-e_{Merc}^{2}\right)}=\frac{7.6531776038 \times 10^{-8}}{0.152427247197} = 5.0208724126 \times 10^{-7}
\end{align}

\textbf{Classical GR prediction for precession:}
\begin{align}
M_{PGR} &= \frac{3\pi R_{Ssun}}{a_{Merc} (1 - e_{Merc}^{2})} = \frac{3 \times 3.14159265359 \times 2953}{5.79 \times 10^{10} \times 0.9577} = 5.0208724126 \times 10^{-7}
\end{align}

\textbf{Relative difference:}
\begin{align}
\frac{M_{PGR} - M_{PWILL}}{M_{PGR}} \times 100 &= \frac{5.0208724126 \times 10^{-7} - 5.0208724126 \times 10^{-7}}{5.0208724126 \times 10^{-7}} \times 100 \\
&= 2.1918652104 \times 10^{-10} \%
\end{align}

This negligible difference is consistent with the numerical precision limits of floating-point arithmetic, confirming that Will Geometry reproduces the observed relativistic precession of Mercury to within machine accuracy.

\end{proof}

\section{Relational Foundation Theorem: WILL vs. GR}

\begin{definition}[GR Core Axioms]
General Relativity (GR) is assumed to rest on the following axioms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(A1)] The spacetime arena is a smooth Lorentzian manifold with metric $g_{\mu\nu}$.
    \item[(A2)] Diffeomorphism invariance (general covariance): the form of physical laws is independent of coordinates.
    \item[(A3)] Local Lorentz invariance / Einstein equivalence principle: locally, spacetime is Minkowskian.
    \item[(A4)] Einstein Field Equations (EFE): $G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[WILL Foundational Postulate]
The WILL framework is based on a single axiom:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(W1)] \textbf{Relational Postulate:} All physical magnitudes are defined purely by relations between entities; spacetime is equivalent to energy evolution.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Relationality in GR]
From A2 and A3 it follows that observable quantities in GR are coordinate-independent
and must be expressed relationally. In particular, no absolute magnitudes can serve
as observables.
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}[Bridge: From Relational Postulate to GR Axioms]
If the Relational Postulate (W1) were false, then physical magnitudes
could in principle be defined in absolute, non-relational terms. 
Such absolutes would provide a hidden external reference structure.
But this contradicts the core of GR:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It violates diffeomorphism invariance (A2), since coordinate independence
    presupposes that only relational quantities are observable.
    \item It undermines the equivalence principle (A3), since local Minkowski structure 
    relies on the impossibility of distinguishing absolute magnitudes from relative ones.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, the negation of W1 directly negates A2 and A3. 
This establishes the logical dependency required for the asymmetry theorem below.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}[Asymmetric Falsifiability of GR and WILL]
\label{thm:asymmetry}
Let $\mathsf{GR}$ denote the theory defined by axioms (A1)--(A4),
and let $\mathsf{WILL}$ denote the theory defined by postulate (W1).
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If (W1) is empirically falsified, then (A2)--(A3) are also falsified. 
    Hence, $\mathsf{GR}$ is necessarily falsified.
    \item If any of (A1)--(A3) are empirically falsified, $\mathsf{GR}$ collapses,
    but (W1) may still remain valid as a stand-alone principle.
\end{enumerate}
Therefore, there exist possible empirical scenarios in which GR fails
while WILL survives, but there exist no scenarios in which WILL fails
while GR survives.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
WILL is axiomatically more fundamental than GR: 
its sole postulate (W1) is logically included within the core axioms of GR, 
while GR requires additional ontological structures 
(metric geometry, equivalence principle, Einstein equations) that are 
not necessary for the consistency of WILL.

\emph{WILL} rests on the single relational postulate (W1). Core GR assumes additional structures (A1--A4). Hence:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If \textbf{W1} is empirically falsified, GR's core (A2--A3) is undermined; thus GR is falsified.
  \item If any of \textbf{A1--A3} is falsified, GR collapses, while \textbf{W1} (and thus WILL) may still hold.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, there are scenarios where GR fails and WILL survives, but none where WILL fails while GR survives.

\section{Geometric Approach}
We begin with a geometric condition that relates the electron's wavelength to the circumference of its orbital. This condition is analogous to the requirement for standing waves, where the wave must close upon itself along the orbital circumference. Specifically, we propose that for an orbital with radius \( r_n \), the following holds:
\begin{equation}
    n \lambda_n = 2\pi r_n, \quad n = 1, 2, 3, \dots
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( \lambda_n \) is the de Broglie wavelength of the electron on the \( n \)-th orbital,
    \item \( r_n \) is the radius of the \( n \)-th orbital,
    \item \( n \) is the principal quantum number.
\end{itemize}
This condition implies that an integer number of wavelengths fit along the circumference of the orbital, a purely geometric constraint that does not require assumptions about the electron's motion.

\subsection{Ontological Status of Quantum Number $n$}

In our geometric framework, the emergence of discrete quantum numbers, conventionally labeled $n=1,2,3,\ldots$, is not a fundamental postulate but a natural consequence of the self-consistency of energy projection geometry. Specifically, the quantum number $n$ corresponds to the number of complete phase rotations (or "wraps") of the energy projection in a closed Will Geometry configuration.

This requirement of \emph{self-closure} is a direct implication of the foundational postulate:

\[
\boxed{\text{spacetime} \equiv \text{energy evolution}}
\]

In the traditional view, $n$ arises as an externally imposed boundary condition to form standing waves. However, in our framework, $n$ emerges from the topological condition that the phase of the energy projection must return to its starting value after encircling the system. This ensures the continuity and completeness of the projection across the closed geometry, without the need for wavefunctions or probabilistic interpretations.

Thus, the quantum number $n$ represents a purely topological invariant of the Will Geometry phase evolution:

\[
\boxed{
n = \text{topological index (phase winding number)}
}
\]

and reflects the intrinsic geometric structure of energy itself, not an arbitrary or externally imposed parameter.


\subsection{Connection to Quantum Mechanics}
According to de Broglie's hypothesis, the wavelength of a particle is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_n = \frac{h}{p_n},
\end{equation}
where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( p_n \) is the momentum of the electron on the \( n \)-th orbital.

Substituting this into our geometric condition (1), we obtain:
\begin{equation}
    n \frac{h}{p_n} = 2\pi r_n.
\end{equation}
Simplifying, we find:
\begin{equation}
    p_n = \frac{n \hbar}{r_n}, \quad \text{where} \quad \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}.
\end{equation}
This provides a relationship between the electron's momentum and the orbital radius. While this result aligns with the Schrödinger equation, where quantization manifests as standing waves, our approach does not require this construction and operates independently.

\section{Physical Model of the Atom}
In the hydrogen atom, the electron is bound to the nucleus by the Coulomb force. Here, the Coulomb attraction provides the centripetal force necessary for the electron's stable orbital leading to: 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{p_n^2}{m_e r_n} = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r_n^2},
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( m_e \) is the electron mass,
    \item \( e \) is the elementary charge,
    \item \( \varepsilon_0 \) is the vacuum permittivity.
\end{itemize}
Rearranging, we get:
\begin{equation}
    p_n^2 = \frac{m_e e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r_n}.
\end{equation}
This equation connects the momentum to the orbital radius through physical constants.

\subsection{Quantization of the Orbital Radius}
We now have two expressions for \( p_n \):
\begin{itemize}
    \item From geometry: \( p_n = \frac{n \hbar}{r_n} \),
    \item From the force balance: \( p_n^2 = \frac{m_e e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r_n} \).
\end{itemize}
Substituting the geometric expression into the force balance equation:
\begin{equation}
    \left( \frac{n \hbar}{r_n} \right)^2 = \frac{m_e e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r_n}.
\end{equation}
Multiplying both sides by \( r_n^2 \):
\begin{equation}
    \frac{n^2 \hbar^2}{r_n} = \frac{m_e e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}.
\end{equation}
Solving for \( r_n \):
\begin{equation}
    r_n = \frac{4\pi \varepsilon_0 n^2 \hbar^2}{m_e e^2} = n^2 a_0,
\end{equation}
where \( a_0 = \frac{4\pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar^2}{m_e e^2} \) is the Bohr radius. This result matches the quantized radii in Bohr's model.

\subsection{Calculation of Energy Levels}
The total energy of the electron is the sum of its kinetic and potential energies:
\begin{equation}
    E_n = K_n + U_n = \frac{p_n^2}{2 m_e} - \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r_n}.
\end{equation}
Using the expression for \( p_n^2 \) from equation (6):
\begin{equation}
    E_n = \frac{1}{2} \frac{m_e e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r_n} - \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r_n} = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 r_n}.
\end{equation}
Substituting \( r_n = n^2 a_0 \):
\begin{equation}
    E_n = -\frac{1}{2} \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 n^2 a_0}.
\end{equation}
Since \( a_0 = \frac{4\pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar^2}{m_e e^2} \), we have:
\begin{equation}
    E_n = -\frac{m_e e^4}{8 \varepsilon_0^2 n^2 \hbar^2}.
\end{equation}
This is the standard expression for the energy levels in the hydrogen atom.

\section{Photoelectric Effect: Geometric Derivation}
\subsection{Experimental Observations}
The photoelectric effect occurs when light incident on a metal surface ejects electrons. Key observations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item There is a \textbf{threshold frequency} \( f_{\text{thresh}} \) below which no electrons are emitted, regardless of intensity.
    \item The \textbf{kinetic energy} of emitted electrons increases with photon frequency, but is independent of intensity.
    \item The number of ejected electrons depends on intensity but their energy does not.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Standard Quantum Mechanical Explanation}
In quantum mechanics, light consists of photons, each carrying energy:
\begin{equation}
    E_{\text{photon}} = h f.
\end{equation}
To eject an electron, this energy must exceed the \textbf{work function} \( W \), which is the minimum energy needed to remove an electron from the metal. The remaining energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the electron:
\begin{equation}
    E_{\text{kin}} = h f - W.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Geometric Interpretation}
In our model, electrons in the metal form \textbf{standing waves} due to boundary conditions imposed by the atomic lattice. These standing waves satisfy the condition:
\begin{equation}
    n \lambda_e = 2L,
\end{equation}
where \( L \) represents an effective confinement region for the electron.

The work function \( W \) corresponds to the characteristic energy of the electron's stationary wave state:
\begin{equation}
    W = \frac{h c}{\lambda_e}.
\end{equation}
For a photon with wavelength \( \lambda_f \), the energy is:
\begin{equation}
    E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{h c}{\lambda_f}.
\end{equation}
If this photon disrupts the standing wave structure, the excess energy contributes to the electron's kinetic energy:
\begin{equation}
    E_{\text{kin}} = \frac{h c}{\lambda_f} - \frac{h c}{\lambda_e}.
\end{equation}
This is mathematically equivalent to Einstein’s equation for the photoelectric effect.

\subsection{Numerical Validation}
We numerically computed the threshold frequencies and kinetic energies for several metals using known work function values. The results are summarized in Table~\ref{table:photoelectric}.

\subsection{Implications}
Our geometric approach suggests that the photoelectric effect is not inherently probabilistic but emerges from standing wave interactions. 



\section{Geometric Derivation of the Fine Structure Constant as a Projection Ratio in WILL Geometry}

\subsection{Motivation and Structural Unity}

The gravitational and electromagnetic forces share a common inverse-square structural form:

\[
F_\text{gravity} = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}, \qquad F_\text{EM} = \frac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}
\]

This structural symmetry suggests a deeper geometric unity. In the WILL framework, gravitation defines a critical radius where the gravitational potential energy equals half the rest mass energy:

\[
U(R_s) = -\frac{Mc^2}{2}, \quad \text{where } R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}
\]

This motivates constructing an analogous critical radius for electromagnetism and deriving atomic structure from pure geometric principles.

---

\subsection{Construction of Electromagnetic Critical Radius}

Following the gravitational analogy, we seek the radius where electromagnetic potential energy equals half the electron rest mass energy:

\[
\frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 R_e} = \frac{m_e c^2}{2}
\]

Solving for the electromagnetic critical radius:

\[
\boxed{
R_e = \frac{2e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 m_e c^2} = 2r_e
}
\]

where \( r_e = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 m_e c^2} \) is the classical electron radius.

**Physical interpretation:** \( R_e \) is the electromagnetic analogue of the Schwarzschild radius — the scale at which EM potential energy equals half the rest mass energy, establishing the critical scale for electromagnetic interactions.

---

\subsection{Geometric Quantization Condition}

We begin with the fundamental geometric condition that relates the electron's wavelength to the circumference of its orbital. This condition is analogous to the requirement for standing waves, where the wave must close upon itself along the orbital circumference:

\[
\boxed{n \lambda_n = 2\pi r_n, \quad n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item \( \lambda_n \) is the de Broglie wavelength of the electron on the \( n \)-th orbital
\item \( r_n \) is the radius of the \( n \)-th orbital  
\item \( n \) is the principal quantum number (topological winding index)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Ontological Status of Quantum Number \( n \):}
In our geometric framework, the quantum number \( n \) corresponds to the number of complete phase rotations of the energy projection in a closed WILL Geometry configuration. This requirement of \emph{self-closure} follows directly from the foundational postulate:
\[
\boxed{\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION}}
\]

Thus, \( n \) represents a purely topological invariant: the phase winding number of Will Geometry phase evolution.

---

\subsection{Connection to Momentum and Force Balance}

According to de Broglie's hypothesis:
\[
\lambda_n = \frac{h}{p_n} \quad \Rightarrow \quad p_n = \frac{n\hbar}{r_n}
\]

In the hydrogen atom, electrostatic force provides the centripetal force:
\[
\frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r_n^2} = \frac{p_n^2}{m_e r_n}
\]

Substituting the geometric momentum relation:
\[
\frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r_n^2} = \frac{(n\hbar/r_n)^2}{m_e r_n} = \frac{n^2\hbar^2}{m_e r_n^3}
\]

Simplifying:
\[
\frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} = \frac{n^2\hbar^2}{m_e r_n}
\]

---

\subsection{Derivation of Quantized Radii}

Solving for the orbital radius:
\[
r_n = \frac{4\pi\varepsilon_0 n^2 \hbar^2}{m_e e^2} = n^2 a_0
\]

where the **Bohr radius** $(a_0)$ emerges naturally:
\[
\boxed{a_0= \frac{4\pi\varepsilon_0 \hbar^2}{m_e e^2}}
\]

This is derived purely from geometric quantization and force balance — no additional postulates required.


\subsection{WILL Geometry Projection Framework}

In WILL geometry, all stable configurations are constrained by a projection ratio:
\[
\boxed{
\kappa^2 = \frac{\text{critical scale}}{\text{current scale}}
}
\]

**Physical Meaning:** This ratio quantifies how much of the available energy budget is projected into gravitational/temporal curvature. When \( \kappa^2 = 1 \), the system reaches maximum curvature (event horizon). When \( \kappa^2 < 1 \), the system operates below this critical threshold.

For electromagnetic systems:
- **Critical scale:** \( R_e \) (electromagnetic critical radius)
- **Current scale:** \( r_n \) (actual orbital radius)

Therefore:
\[
\kappa_n^2 = \frac{R_e}{r_n} = \frac{R_e}{n^2 a_0}
\]

For the ground state (\( n = 1 \)):
\[
\kappa_1^2 = \frac{R_e}{a_0} = \frac{2e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 m_e c^2} \cdot \frac{m_e e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 \hbar^2} = \frac{2e^4}{(4\pi\varepsilon_0)^2 \hbar^2 c^2}
\]

---

\subsection{Connection to Fine Structure Constant}

The fine structure constant is defined as:
\[
\alpha = \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 \hbar c} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \alpha^2 = \frac{e^4}{(4\pi\varepsilon_0)^2 \hbar^2 c^2}
\]

Therefore:
\[
\kappa_1^2 = 2\alpha^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \boxed{\kappa_1 = \sqrt{2}\alpha}
\]

From the fundamental WILL constraint \( \kappa^2 = 2\beta^2 \):
\[
2\alpha^2 = 2\beta_1^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \boxed{\beta_1 = \alpha}
\]

**Fundamental Discovery:** The fine structure constant \( \alpha \) emerges naturally as the kinetic projection parameter \( \beta \) for the ground state of hydrogen.

---

\subsection{Energy Quantization from Geometric Projections}

Using the WILL energy formula:
\[
E_n = \beta_n^2 \cdot \frac{m_e c^2}{2} = \frac{\alpha^2}{2n^2} m_e c^2
\]

For the ground state:
\[
E_1 = \frac{\alpha^2}{2} m_e c^2 = \frac{(7.297 \times 10^{-3})^2}{2} \times 0.511 \text{ MeV} \approx 13.606 \text{ eV}
\]

Perfect agreement with experimental hydrogen ionization energy.

**General formula:**
\[
\boxed{E_n = \frac{\alpha^2 m_e c^2}{2n^2} = \frac{13.606}{n^2} \text{ eV}}
\]

---

\subsection{Verification Through Orbital Velocity}

The orbital velocity can be calculated from the kinetic projection:
\[
v_n = \beta_n c = \frac{\alpha c}{n}
\]

For the ground state:
\[
v_1 = \alpha c = 7.297 \times 10^{-3} \times 2.998 \times 10^8 = 2.188 \times 10^6 \text{ m/s}
\]

This can be independently verified through force balance:
\[
v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 m_e a_0}} = \sqrt{\frac{R_e}{2a_0}} \cdot c = \alpha c
\]

Perfect consistency confirms our geometric derivation.

 

\subsection{Summary of Geometric Unification}

\begin{itemize}
\item Starting from pure geometric quantization (\( n\lambda = 2\pi r \)), we derived the Bohr radius without additional assumptions.
\item The electromagnetic critical radius \( R_e = 2r_e \) establishes the natural scale for EM interactions.
\item The fine structure constant \( \alpha \) emerges as the kinetic projection parameter \( \beta \) in hydrogen.
\item The gravitational projection \( \kappa = \sqrt{2}\alpha \) follows from fundamental WILL constraints.
\item All hydrogen energy levels are reproduced exactly through geometric energy projection.
\item No quantum wavefunctions, probabilistic interpretations, or additional postulates were required.
\end{itemize}

This establishes that atomic structure arises naturally from the geometric evolution of energy projections in spacetime, demonstrating the fundamental unity underlying electromagnetic and gravitational phenomena in WILL Geometry.
