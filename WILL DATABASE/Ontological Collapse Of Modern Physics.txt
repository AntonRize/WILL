Ontological Collapse: Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Formalisms as Degenerate Approximations of Relational Geometry

“There is no such thing as an empty space, i.e., a space without field. . . . Space-time does not claim existence on its own, but only as a structural quality of the field.”

— Albert Einstein, Relativity: The Special and the General Theory (1952)

Abstract

This paper's central thesis is that the foundational Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms of classical mechanics are not fundamental principles but are, in fact, ontologically corrupted, single-point approximations of a more profound, two-point relational geometry. We identify the core philosophical error of modern physics as the artificial and un-evidenced separation of spacetime and energy—the positing of a structural background upon which dynamics unfold. As a corrective, we introduce WILL Relational Geometry (RG), a framework built upon the single unifying principle of SPACETIME ≡ ENERGY. The primary consequence of this principle is the Energy-Symmetry Law, a statement of perfect causal continuity between distinct states. This paper will demonstrate, through direct algebraic derivation, how the revered formalisms of conventional mechanics emerge from the "ontological collapse" of this generative relational law, revealing them to be degenerate shadows of a simpler and more fundamental reality.

1. Introduction: The Unpaid Ontological Debt in Modern Physics

Theoretical physics today stands at a peculiar crossroads. It is a discipline of profound empirical success, capable of predictions of astonishing accuracy, yet it is simultaneously burdened by increasing foundational complexity. The standard models of cosmology and particle physics are beset by singularities, populated by ad-hoc "dark" components, and cleaved by a persistent and deep conceptual divide between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. This state of affairs suggests that while our descriptive power is immense, our fundamental understanding may be incomplete.

This paper asserts that this fragmentation is not a feature of reality but a symptom of a foundational philosophical error, an unpaid ontological debt incurred at the outset. This error is the un-evidenced metaphysical postulate that separates reality into two distinct substances: structure and dynamics. In practice, this manifests as a bi-variable syntax common to all contemporary theories:

fixed manifold + metric (structure) + fields + constants (dynamics)

WILL Relational Geometry (RG) is a generative framework that resolves this fragmentation by subtracting this hidden assumption of separation. It proceeds from a single corrective principle that dissolves the distinction: SPACETIME ≡ ENERGY. From this unification, a more constrained and powerful model of reality emerges not by adding new postulates, but by removing an old and unjustified one.

The argument of this paper will proceed in three stages. First, we will establish the core principles of Relational Geometry that emerge necessarily from this unified view. Second, we will derive the fundamental law of dynamics native to this framework—the Energy-Symmetry Law. Third, and most critically, we will demonstrate decisively that the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms are not fundamental laws of nature but are its degenerate, collapsed approximations. To begin, we must first examine in detail the foundational flaw that makes this corrective framework necessary.

2. The False Separation: An Un-evidenced Metaphysical Postulate

Progress in science often hinges on the identification and removal of hidden assumptions—the unquestioned articles of faith that structure a paradigm. We argue that the separation of a passive structural background (spacetime) from the active dynamical content (energy) is the most consequential and least examined of these assumptions in modern physics.

The history of physics provides a clear pattern: major breakthroughs have consistently involved the elimination of artificial separations, thereby widening the relational circle and reducing the number of unexplained absolutes.

* Copernicus eliminated the Earth/cosmos separation.
* Newton eliminated the terrestrial/celestial law separation.
* Maxwell eliminated the electricity/magnetism separation.
* Einstein eliminated the space/time separation.

Each step was a victory for minimalism and relationalism. The spacetime–energy split appears to be the only survivor of this critical pruning sequence—the last geocentric epicycle in physics.

Challenging this separation requires an audit of its empirical basis, which proves to be remarkably thin. The experiments typically cited in its favor are, upon closer inspection, internal consistency checks of a formalism that already presupposes the split, not positive evidence for the split itself.

* Local energy conservation is only ever verified after a metric is declared fixed. No experiment has ever varied the volume of empty space and checked for a corresponding calorimetric effect.
* The universality of free fall confirms the numerical equality of inertial and gravitational mass, but it does not validate the deeper claim that inertia resides in an object rather than emerging from a geometric scaling relation.
* Tests of gravitational phenomena like the Casimir effect or Lamb shift measure energy differences between distinct geometries; the absolute bulk term is explicitly subtracted, leaving the foundational split untouched.

Until an experiment can vary the properties of spacetime while holding all dynamical content fixed, the separation remains an un-evidenced metaphysical postulate. This critique is formalized in the following lemma.

Lemma 2.1 (False Separation) Any model that treats processes as unfolding within an independent background necessarily assigns to that background structural features (metric, orientation, or frame) not derivable from the relations among the processes themselves. Such a background constitutes an extraneous absolute.

Proof: Suppose an independent background exists. Then at least one of its structural attributes—metric relations, a preferred orientation, or a class of inertial frames—remains fixed regardless of interprocess data. This attribute is not relationally inferred but posited a priori. It thereby violates the relational closure principle: it introduces a non-relational absolute external to the system. Hence the separation is illicit.

The necessary solution is the dissolution of this artificial distinction, which leads directly to the foundational principle of Relational Geometry.

3. The Principles of Relational Geometry: From Unity to Structure

By removing the false separation between structure and dynamics, we do not create a theoretical vacuum. Instead, a new, more constrained, and ultimately more powerful physical framework emerges. This framework, WILL Relational Geometry (RG), does not add postulates but derives its entire structure from a single, minimalist principle of unity.

The framework is founded on a principle of negative ontological weight; it removes a hidden assumption rather than adding a new one.

Principle 3.1 (Ontological Principle) The distinction between structure (spacetime) and dynamics (energy) is dissolved. They are two descriptive projections of a single, invariant, relational entity.

We use the technical term WILL to denote this unified relational structure.

From this starting point, the framework is guided by a set of strict methodological cornerstones designed to prevent the re-introduction of metaphysical artifacts.

1. Epistemic Hygiene: A refusal to import any unjustified assumptions. The framework must contain zero free parameters and retain no constructs unless they are geometrically or energetically necessary.
2. Ontological Minimalism: The theory must proceed from the minimum possible number of assumptions. The burden of proof lies with any assertion that introduces additional complexity or new entities.
3. Relational Origin: All physical quantities must be defined exclusively by their relations to other quantities. The introduction of absolute properties is prohibited.
4. Mathematical Transparency: The formalism must be semantically transparent. Every symbol must be anchored to a unique physical idea, and the number of symbols must equal the number of independent physical ideas they encode.

These principles, applied to the core SPACETIME ≡ ENERGY identity, lead to a series of necessary geometric consequences. The unified entity, WILL, must be self-contained (Closure), its total transformational resource must be conserved (Conservation), and it can have no a priori privileged direction (Isotropy). These properties are not postulates but logical entailments of a background-free, relational system.

These necessary properties, in turn, uniquely determine the geometric architectures that are capable of encoding energy relations.

Theorem 3.1 (Minimal Relational Carriers) The minimal relational manifolds satisfying the derived constraints of Closure, Conservation, and maximal Symmetry are:

1. The circle S¹ for directional (kinematic) relational transformations.
2. The sphere S² for omnidirectional (gravitational) relational transformations.

Proof: The proof proceeds by classifying the minimal types of relations and applying the derived constraints.

(a) Directional (Kinematic) Relation: The simplest non-trivial relation is a 1-degree-of-freedom transformation between State A and State B. This interaction is necessarily one-dimensional. By Lemma (Closure), this 1D geometry must be closed. By Lemma (Isotropy), it must be maximally symmetric. The classification of connected, closed, 1-manifolds yields the circle, S¹, as the unique carrier satisfying these constraints.

(b) Omnidirectional (Gravitational) Relation: The other minimal relation is a 2-degree-of-freedom transformation from a central state to the locus of all equidistant states (e.g., an orbit). This relation must be encoded on a minimal 2D surface. By Lemma (Closure), this surface must be closed. By Lemma (Isotropy), it must be maximally symmetric. By the classification of constant-curvature surfaces, the unique closed, simply connected, maximally symmetric 2-manifold is the 2-sphere, S².

The Principle of Ontological Minimalism forbids the use of more complex carriers, thus uniquely and necessarily selecting S¹ and S² as the minimal relational architectures.

It is critical to understand that S¹ and S² are not spatial entities existing within some larger container. They are the abstract relational architectures that mathematically implement the SPACETIME ≡ ENERGY identity. These geometric carriers give rise to a fundamental law of dynamic interaction that forms the generative core of the RG framework.

4. The Energy-Symmetry Law: The Generative Core of Dynamics

This section derives the true, uncorrupted law of dynamics that is native to Relational Geometry. Unlike the conventional approach, which postulates laws to fit observations, RG generates its dynamical law as a necessary consequence of its foundational principle. This law governs the exchange of energy in any closed interaction.

To ground the formalism, we define the dimensionless projections onto the relational carriers: the kinematic projection β = v/c, where v is relative velocity, and the potential projection κ = v_e/c, where v_e is the local escape velocity. These represent the normalized kinetic and potential energy budgets of a system.

Theorem 4.1 (Energy Symmetry) The specific energy differences (per unit of rest energy) perceived by two observers for a transition between their states balance according to the Energy-Symmetry Law:

This law represents a principle of perfect causal continuity and relational bookkeeping. In RG, energy is defined as the relational measure of difference between two distinct states, A and B. The law states that in any closed cycle of transformations, the perceived energy change from A's perspective must be equal and opposite to the perceived energy change from B's perspective.

The derivation of this law follows from analyzing a transition between two states—for example, an object at rest on a planetary surface (State A) and the same object in a stable orbit (State B). The specific energy transfer for the A→B transition is given by the sum of the changes in the potential and kinetic energy budgets:

ΔE_(A→B) = ½((κ_A² - κ_B²) + (β_B² - β_A²))

Here, κ² represents the dimensionless potential budget and β² represents the dimensionless kinetic budget. The factor of 1/2 is not arbitrary but originates from the quadratic nature of the energy budgets on the closed relational carriers, S¹ and S², where energy is proportional to the square of a geometric projection. This factor is a geometric necessity. The reverse transfer, ΔE_(B→A), is identical in magnitude but opposite in sign, ensuring their sum is zero.

Crucially, this is a two-point relational law. It defines dynamics not as a property of a single point in a field, but as a conserved relationship between two distinct states, A and B. This distinction is the key to understanding how conventional mechanics can be derived as a degenerate case. This "clean" relational law serves as the foundation from which the "dirty" approximations of conventional mechanics can now be derived through a process of ontological collapse.

5. The Ontological Collapse: Deriving L & H as Degenerate Approximations

This section demonstrates that the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms are not fundamental laws but are mathematical artifacts that emerge when the rich, two-point relational structure of the Energy-Symmetry Law is forcibly collapsed into a single-point description. This collapse constitutes an ontological error, but one that yields empirically adequate approximations under classical conditions.

The First Collapse: The Lagrangian

The standard Lagrangian is defined as the difference between kinetic and potential energy: L = T - U. With the conventional definition of gravitational potential energy U = -GMm/r, this becomes: L = ½ m v² - (-GMm/r) = ½ m v² + GMm/r

We begin with the clean relational Lagrangian, a two-point expression representing the kinetic budget at point B relative to the potential budget at point A: L_rel / E₀ = ½(β_B² + κ_A²) This form correctly maintains the conceptual and physical distinction between the kinetic state at r_B (observer B) and the potential reference at r_A (observer A).

The first ontological violation occurs when we artificially identify these two distinct points by setting r_A = r_B = r. This mathematical act collapses the relational structure into a local, single-point function. With the relational definitions T = ½mc²β² and U = -½mc²κ², the expression degenerates into the structural form of the standard Newtonian Lagrangian.

The Second Collapse: The Hamiltonian

The Hamiltonian is defined as the total energy of the system: H = T + U. Using the same conventions, this becomes: H = ½ m v² + (-GMm/r) = ½ m v² - GMm/r

This form emerges from the specific energy invariant of the relational system, W = ½(κ² - β²). After collapsing the reference points (r_A = r_B), this invariant takes the structural form of the Hamiltonian. A direct comparison reveals the nature of the collapse:

Formalism	Conventional Mechanics (A = B)	Relational Geometry (A ≠ B)
Lagrangian	L = T - U ⇔ ½mc²(β² + κ²)	L_rel ∝ (β_B² + κ_A²)
Hamiltonian	H = T + U ⇔ ½mc²(β² - κ²)	W ∝ (κ_A² - β_B²)

The apparent sign difference between L and H in conventional mechanics is not a fundamental property of energy. It is an artifact created by collapsing the distinct potential (κ_A²) and kinetic (β_B²) terms of a two-point relation into a single, shared coordinate r.

The Third Collapse: Newton's Third Law

Even Newton's Third Law can be shown to be a degenerate consequence of this collapse.

Theorem 5.1 (Newton's Third Law as a Degenerate Consequence) The Energy-Symmetry Law (ΔE_(A→B) + ΔE_(B→A) = 0) mathematically necessitates Newton's Third Law (F_AB = -F_BA) in the classical limit where the two-point relational energy budget is collapsed into a single-point potential function U(r).

Proof: When the two-point relational law is approximated by a single potential function U(r) dependent only on the relative position r = r_B - r_A, the forces on B by A (F_AB) and on A by B (F_BA) are defined as the negative gradients of U with respect to their coordinates.

Force on B by A: F_AB = -∇_B U(r_B - r_A) = -∇U(r)

Force on A by B: F_BA = -∇_A U(r_B - r_A) = -∇U(r) · (-I) = +∇U(r)

A straightforward application of the chain rule shows that the conclusion F_AB = -F_BA becomes a mathematical tautology of the collapsed formalism, not an independent physical principle.

This process of degeneracy can be formalized using category theory. Relational Geometry operates at the level of a Groupoid, which describes transformations between specific states (A→B). Conventional field theories degenerate this rich structure into a Group, which acts globally on all points of a presupposed manifold, requiring an external background. The revered formalisms of classical mechanics have thus been revealed as shadows of a deeper, simpler relational truth.

6. Philosophical Implications: Complexity as a Symptom of Negligence

The derivations in the previous section have profound consequences that extend beyond mathematics into the philosophy of science. They demonstrate that the choice of philosophical starting points—in this case, the decision to postulate a separation between spacetime and energy—has direct, measurable effects on the resulting physical formalism. The "bad philosophy" of the ontological split carries tangible costs.

The wages of this philosophical error are threefold:

1. Inflated Formalism: Equations multiply to compensate for the ontological error. The simple, algebraic Energy-Symmetry Law is replaced by a system of differential equations (Lagrange's equations) and coordinate-dependent fields.
2. Loss of Transparency: Physical meaning becomes obscured behind layers of mathematical abstraction. The clear, relational meaning of energy budgets is lost in the coordinate dependencies of potentials and fields.
3. Empirical Fragmentation: Different domains of physics require separate constants and ad-hoc entities (like dark matter and dark energy) to patch the holes created by the incomplete foundational model.

By contrast, the "good philosophy" of epistemic hygiene, which enforces relational closure from the outset, yields a formalism of remarkable simplicity. RG achieves this simplicity not through approximation, but through logical necessity. By refusing to introduce unjustified entities, the framework is forced to discover the intrinsic geometric relationships that govern reality.

This leads to a pair of core aphorisms that summarize the central lesson of Relational Geometry:

Bad philosophy creates complexity. Good philosophy reveals geometry.

The historical escalation of mathematical complexity in physics did not necessarily reveal a deeper or more complex reality. In many cases, it merely compensated for an initial philosophical mistake.

Mathematical complexity is the symptom of philosophical negligence.

The validity of this philosophical critique is ultimately demonstrated by the broad explanatory power of the un-collapsed relational framework, which seamlessly derives phenomena that conventional physics must postulate or treat as anomalous.

7. Conclusion: From Descriptive Laws to Generative Geometry

This paper's central conclusion can be stated in clear and forceful terms: The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms are ontologically collapsed approximations of the two-point relational Energy-Symmetry Law, which is the native law of dynamics within WILL Relational Geometry.

Our argument proceeded along a clear logical chain. We began by critiquing the un-evidenced metaphysical postulate of a spacetime-energy split. We then demonstrated how a complete physical framework could be derived from the single corrective principle SPACETIME ≡ ENERGY. Finally, we showed through direct algebraic derivation how the foundational laws of classical mechanics emerge as degenerate, single-point shadows of the true, two-point relational law.

This conclusion calls for a fundamental paradigm shift in how we view physical law itself. The physics of the past has been largely a descriptive enterprise, codifying empirical regularities and observations into laws. This approach treats laws as external assumptions introduced to model reality. The framework of RG, by contrast, offers a generative physics, in which phenomena are not merely described but are derived as the inevitable geometric consequences of a single, self-consistent relational principle. This shift from descriptive laws to generative geometry is not merely a preference; it is the necessary next step to resolve the deep foundational problems—from singularities to dark energy—that currently plague theoretical physics.

The entire structure of reality, from the laws of motion to the nature of spacetime itself, appears to emerge from the logical and geometric necessities of a single, unified whole.

Spacetime and energy are mutually defining aspects of a single relational structure.
