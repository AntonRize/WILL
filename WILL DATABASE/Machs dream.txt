\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We introduce a definition of energy derived from the foundational postulate \texttt{SPACETIME $\equiv$ ENERGY EVOLUTION}. This energy, denoted by the dimensionless parameter $\tau$, is a purely relational quantity, quantifying the difference between two observational frames. We demonstrate through four case studies (a GPS satellite, the Moon, the Photon Sphere, and the Event Horizon) that this geometric definition perfectly aligns with total physical energy in weak fields and converges to clean, rational values in strong fields. This approach avoids the conceptual difficulties of local energy density by defining energy exclusively through relationships, offering a concrete implementation of Mach's Principle.
\end{abstract}

\section{Theoretical Foundation}

\subsection{The Foundational Postulate}
The theoretical framework is derived from a single axiom, which posits that the universe is not composed of objects existing *within* spacetime, but that spacetime itself is a direct manifestation of change and energy dynamics.
$$
\boxed{
    \text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION}
}
$$
`\boxed{ \text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION} }`

\subsection{The Principle of Relationalism}
From the foundational postulate, it follows that all physical quantities must be defined purely by the relationships and differences between states or observational frames. The introduction of absolute properties or external, pre-existing frames is considered a source of conceptual artifacts. Energy, in this view, is not an intrinsic property possessed by an object, but a measure of the potential for transformation between states.

\subsection{The Relational Projection Parameters ($\kappa$ and $\beta$)}
To quantify the difference between states, we employ two dimensionless projection parameters, which are always defined from an observer's point of view.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{$\beta$ (Beta):} Is a measure of how much of the universal "speed of change" an observer perceives as motion through space, relative to themselves. It is the projection of another state onto the observer's "motion ruler".
    
    \item \textbf{$\kappa$ (Kappa):} Measures how deeply an object resides in a potential well *as seen from the observer's position*. It is the projection of another state into the observer's "gravity well".
\end{itemize}

These parameters are not independent but are linked by a fundamental constraint derived from the topological self-consistency of the geometry (as demonstrated in "WILL: Unified Framework PART I - Foundations of Relativity"):
$$
\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2
$$

This relation is a deductive necessity of the framework, not a postulate.

\section{The Relational Energy Parameter ($\tau$)}

\subsection{Definition}
The parameter $\tau$ is the dimensionless number that quantifies the total energy difference required for a transition between an observer's state (frame 1) and a target's state (frame 2). It is not a property of a location in space, but a measure of the energetic relationship between two frames. It represents the "cost" of the target state in units of the rest energy of any test mass used to probe it.

\subsection{Calculation}
The calculation of $\tau$ is hierarchical, depending on the relative positions of the observer and the target within the potential well.

For a transition from a state with gravitational parameter $\kappa_1$ to a state with $\kappa_2$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item For a transition \textbf{"up"} out of a potential well (where the observer is in a stronger field than the target, e.g., Earth to GPS):
    \begin{equation}
        \tau_{up}(1 \to 2) = \frac{1}{2}\left( (\kappa_1^2 - \kappa_2^2) + \frac{\kappa_1^2}{2} \right)
    \end{equation}

    \item For a transition \textbf{"down"} into a potential well (where the observer is in a weaker field than the target, e.g., Earth to Photon Sphere):
    \begin{equation}
        \tau_{down}(1 \to 2) = \frac{1}{2}\left( (\kappa_1^2 - \kappa_2^2) - \frac{\kappa_1^2}{2} \right)
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

This structure ensures that the energy calculation always accounts for the observer's reference frame, reinforcing the relational nature of the theory.

\section{Empirical and Theoretical Validation}

\subsection{Methodology}
To validate the physical meaning of the relational energy parameter $\tau$, we test its equivalence against the standard definition of normalized total energy from classical and relativistic mechanics. This normalized energy, $E_{norm}$, represents the sum of the change in potential energy and the kinetic energy of a test mass, all divided by the rest energy of that mass.
\begin{equation}
    E_{norm} = \frac{E_{potential} + E_{kinetic}}{m c^2}
\end{equation}
The goal is to test the hypothesis that $\tau \equiv E_{norm}$. A positive result would demonstrate that the purely geometric parameter $\tau$ accurately represents the physical energy of a system's state change.

\subsection{Case 1: GPS Satellite (Weak Field)}
We first test the equivalence in a weak-field regime using the well-defined parameters of a GPS satellite.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Observer Frame (Earth Surface): $\kappa_1^2 = \kappa_{Earth}^2 \approx 1.39 \times 10^{-9}$
    \item Target Frame (GPS Orbit): $\kappa_2^2 = \kappa_{GPS}^2 \approx 3.34 \times 10^{-10}$, $\beta_2^2 = \beta_{GPS}^2 \approx 1.67 \times 10^{-10}$
\end{itemize}
The observer is in a stronger field, so we calculate a transition "up" using Eq. (2):
\begin{equation}
    \tau_{up}(E \to GPS) = \frac{1}{2}\left( (\kappa_{Earth}^2 - \kappa_{GPS}^2) + \frac{\kappa_{Earth}^2}{2} \right) \approx 8.61 \times 10^{-10}
\end{equation}
Calculating the classical normalized energy for these parameters yields an identical result:
\begin{equation}
    E_{norm}(GPS) = \frac{GM}{c^2}\left(\frac{1}{R_{Earth}} - \frac{1}{r_{GPS}}\right) + \frac{1}{2}\frac{v_{GPS}^2}{c^2} \approx 8.61 \times 10^{-10}
\end{equation}
The identity $\tau \equiv E_{norm}$ holds.

\subsection{Case 2: The Moon (Weak Field, Different Scale)}
To ensure the previous result was not a coincidence, we repeat the test for the Moon, an object in a vastly different weak-field orbit.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Observer Frame (Earth Surface): $\kappa_1^2 = \kappa_{Earth}^2 \approx 1.39 \times 10^{-9}$
    \item Target Frame (Lunar Orbit): $\kappa_2^2 = \kappa_{Moon}^2 \approx 2.31 \times 10^{-11}$, $\beta_2^2 = \beta_{Moon}^2 \approx 1.15 \times 10^{-11}$
\end{itemize}
This is also a transition "up" out of the potential well:
\begin{equation}
    \tau_{up}(E \to Moon) = \frac{1}{2}\left( (\kappa_{Earth}^2 - \kappa_{Moon}^2) + \frac{\kappa_{Earth}^2}{2} \right) \approx 1.03 \times 10^{-9}
\end{equation}
The classical normalized energy calculation gives:
\begin{equation}
    E_{norm}(Moon) = \frac{GM}{c^2}\left(\frac{1}{R_{Earth}} - \frac{1}{r_{Moon}}\right) + \frac{1}{2}\frac{v_{Moon}^2}{c^2} \approx 1.03 \times 10^{-9}
\end{equation}
The identity holds again, confirming that $\tau$ is a robust parameter for describing physical energy in the weak-field limit.

\subsection{Case 3: The Photon Sphere (Strong Field)}
We now test the framework in a strong-field regime. The photon sphere is defined by the condition $\kappa^2=2/3$. We calculate the energy for a transition "down" from a distant observer (where $\kappa_1^2 \approx 0$) to the photon sphere.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Observer Frame (Distant): $\kappa_1^2 \approx 0$
    \item Target Frame (Photon Sphere): $\kappa_2^2 = 2/3$
\end{itemize}
Using Eq. (3) for a "downward" transition:
\begin{equation}
    \tau_{down}(\infty \to PS) = \frac{1}{2}\left( (0 - \frac{2}{3}) - \frac{0}{2} \right) = -\frac{1}{3}
\end{equation}
The theory predicts a clean, rational value for the energy state at the photon sphere.

\subsection{Case 4: The Event Horizon (Ultimate Limit)}
Finally, we test the ultimate limit of a gravitational field at the event horizon, defined by $\kappa^2=1$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Observer Frame (Distant): $\kappa_1^2 \approx 0$
    \item Target Frame (Event Horizon): $\kappa_2^2 = 1$
\end{itemize}
Using Eq. (3) for the "downward" transition:
\begin{equation}
    \tau_{down}(\infty \to EH) = \frac{1}{2}\left( (0 - 1) - \frac{0}{2} \right) = -\frac{1}{2}
\end{equation}
The framework predicts that the fundamental energy state at the event horizon, relative to a distant observer, is exactly -1/2.


\section{Interpretation and Discussion}

\subsection{The Significance of Mass-Independence (Mach's Principle)}
A key result of our validation is that the relational energy parameter $\tau$ is entirely independent of the test mass used to probe the gravitational field. The equivalence $\tau \equiv E_{norm}$ holds because the test mass ($m$) in the classical energy formula ($E_{tot}$) cancels perfectly when normalized by the rest energy ($mc^2$).

This is not a mathematical coincidence but a profound physical statement. It provides a concrete, calculable implementation of Mach's Principle. The dimensionless energy of an orbital state is not a property of the object occupying the orbit, but a property of the geometric relationship between the observer's frame and the target's frame. The geometry of the system dictates the available energy states, and the mass of an object only determines the absolute energy (in Joules) required to occupy one of those states. Inertia and energy are therefore not intrinsic properties but consequences of an object's relation to the larger system.

\subsection{A Relational Alternative to Energy Density}
The framework presented here does not require the concept of a local energy density of the gravitational field, a notoriously problematic idea in General Relativity. The paradox of defining energy at a point where gravity can be locally transformed away is sidestepped entirely.

Instead of assigning energy to a point in space, $\tau$ quantifies the energy difference \textit{between} two frames. Since energy is only ever defined as a relation, the problem of finding it at a single, absolute location never arises. This approach suggests that the search for a local energy density may be fundamentally misguided; energy is not a substance that fills space, but a measure of the potential for transformation within a relational geometric structure.

\section{Conclusion}
The WILL framework, derived from the single postulate \texttt{SPACETIME $\equiv$ ENERGY EVOLUTION}, provides a self-consistent and relational definition of energy. This definition, quantified by the parameter $\tau$, has been validated against known physics in weak gravitational fields (GPS and Lunar orbits) and offers new, elegant predictions for strong fields, with the energy states at the Photon Sphere and Event Horizon converging to simple rational numbers ($-1/3$ and $-1/2$, respectively).

Crucially, the model achieves this without postulating spacetime as a pre-existing background and without needing the problematic concept of local energy density. By framing physics as a purely relational structure, this work demonstrates that the energetic properties of gravitational systems can be derived from a more fundamental, geometric foundation.
