\begin{abstract}
This paper, the first in the WILL series, introduces a new theoretical framework that shifts the paradigm from a descriptive to a \textbf{generative model} of physics, providing a unified derivation of Special and General Relativity from first principles. The model is founded on the \textbf{single postulate} that $\boxed{\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION}}$, from which all physical laws are deductively derived without free parameters. Key results include: the \textit{ab initio} geometric derivation of the energy-momentum relation ($E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$); a fundamental unifying equation, $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$, which is shown to be a necessary consequence of the topology of the underlying projection manifolds; and an algebraic field equation, $\frac{R_s}{r_{d}} = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{max}}$, that serves as a local equivalent to Einstein's Field Equations.

By construction, this geometric approach \textbf{inherently resolves the problem of singularities} by imposing a natural maximum on curvature, and it successfully \textbf{reconstructs the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics} from its core projections. The framework offers significant \textbf{conceptual clarity and computational simplicity} by replacing complex tensor formalism with transparent geometric relations. Furthermore, it demonstrates complete \textbf{theoretical closure} (the "Theoretical Ouroboros"), wherein the foundational postulate deductively leads to a field equation that fully embodies it. The model's predictions are shown to be in precise agreement with key empirical tests, including the precession of Mercury, GPS time corrections, and the orbital decay of binary pulsars, establishing a robust foundation for subsequent papers on cosmology (Part II) and quantum mechanics (Part III).

\section{WILL: A Relational Framework for Space-Time-Energy}


\section{Methodological Purity and Epistemic Minimalism}

\subsection{Foundational Approach}

The framework of WILL Geometry is built from a single postulate and zero free parameters. This construction is not a simplification — it is a deliberate epistemic constraint. No assumptions are introduced unless they are strictly derivable from first principles, and no constructs are retained unless they are geometrically or energetically necessary.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Guiding Principle]
\textbf{Nothing is assumed. Everything is derived.}\\
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Epistemic Hygiene}

Modern theoretical physics often tolerates hidden assumptions: arbitrary constants, renormalization techniques, or abstract entities with ambiguous physical status. WILL Geometry, by contrast, enforces what we call \textbf{epistemic hygiene} — a disciplined refusal to smuggle explanatory weight into unjustified assumptions. All physical quantities, including space, time, mass, and energy, emerge from relational energy geometry and causal structure.

\subsection{No Ontological Commitments}

This model makes no ontological claims about the "existence" of space, particles, or fields. Instead, all phenomena are treated as observer-dependent energetic projections.

\subsection{Motivation and Core Principles}

The standard formulation of General Relativity often relies on the concept of an asymptotically flat spacetime, introducing an implicit external reference frame beyond the physical systems under study. While some modern approaches (e.g., shape dynamics) seek greater relationality, we proceed from strict epistemic minimalism, disallowing all background structures, even hidden or asymptotic ones.

\textbf{Principle:} \emph{All physical quantities must be defined purely by their relations.} Any introduction of absolute properties or external frames risks reintroducing metaphysical artifacts and contradicts the foundational insight of relativity.

\textbf{What is Energy?} Energy is not an intrinsic property of objects, but a measure of difference between possible states. It expresses the system's capacity to transition, always encountered as a relative potential for change—not as something possessed, but as a comparative structure between observers. In this framework, energy marks the tendency for one configuration to transform into another. 

\[
\begin{array}{c} \boxed{ 
\begin{array}{c} 
\text{Energy } \text{ is not an intrinsic property,} \\ 
\text{but a } \textit{measure of difference} \\ 
\text{between possible states. }
\end{array} 
} \end{array}
\]

\section{Single Unifying Postulate}
\vspace{1em}
We therefore posit a single unifying postulate:

\[
\boxed{\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION}}
\]

\textbf{Clarification:} By ``energy evolution'' we mean the total structure of possible transitions between observable states---not a process unfolding in spacetime, but the very relational geometry from which both space and time emerge. This is not a derived result, but a foundational postulate, subject to geometric and empirical audit in subsequent sections. ``WILL'' is used here as a technical term for this unified, emergent structure.

The goal of this framework is not merely to reconstruct the formulas of Special and General Relativity, but to demonstrate that they are the unique and necessary consequences of a single, deeper principle of relational geometry. By showing \textit{why} these specific mathematical structures must arise, the model provides a more fundamental explanation for them than the standard formalisms alone.

\subsection{Fundamental Structure of WILL}

From our postulate, several key properties of the WILL framework can be derived:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Self-contained structure:} Since spacetime is identical to energy evolution, there can be no external objects or reference frames. The WILL framework therefore admits no background container in which energy “sits.” What we call “geometry” here refers not to spatial form, but to the relational configuration space of energy itself. 
    
    \item \textbf{Conservation law:} A closed configuration naturally leads to conservation principles—nothing enters or leaves the system, making the total energy constant.
    
    \item \textbf{Symmetry:} With no external reference, all relations must be equivalent; any asymmetry would require a preferred frame, which is disallowed.
    
    \item \textbf{Circular/spherical configuration:} Among all closed and maximally symmetric manifolds in parameter space, the circle (and, in higher dimensions, the surface of the sphere) uniquely preserves equivalence of all points and directions. These are not spatial objects, but abstract topological constructs encoding the closure of energy relations. Their role is to guarantee that no hidden reference structure or asymmetry contaminates the algebra. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Emergence of Space and Time}
\textit{In this construction, “space’’ and “time’’ are not assumed as pre-existing containers, but arise as complementary projections of the underlying rate and direction of energetic transformation along the closed relational structure.}

The word "evolution" in our postulate implies a non-instantaneous process, requiring a rate of change. This rate naturally establishes a relationship between what we perceive as spatial and temporal units, yielding the speed of evolution.

Any energy state can be represented as a point on the abstract circle. Changes in energy states correspond to movement along this circle, characterized by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Speed of state change (rate of evolution)
    \item Direction of state change
\end{itemize}

These two orthogonal components naturally give rise to what we interpret as space-like and time-like dimensions, without presupposing coordinate axes or external geometry. 

Among closed, orientable, simply-connected manifolds of constant positive curvature,
\begin{itemize}
  \item in 1-D, the circle $S^{1}$ is unique;
  \item in 2-D, the 2-sphere $S^{2}$ is unique.
\end{itemize}
These manifolds are distinguished by having the largest possible isometry group acting transitively, thereby eliminating any preferred directions or cycles. Within WILL they serve not as spatial surfaces but as the only projection arenas consistent with the postulate of energy evolution and its demand for internal symmetry. 

\begin{theorem}[WILL Closure]
Spacetime $\equiv$ Energy Evolution.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Sketch]
Sections 4–17 supply the chained steps:
closed-manifold symmetry $\rightarrow$ projection algebra
$\rightarrow$ relativistic factors $\rightarrow$ unified field identity.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Fundamental Axiom: WILL‐Manifold \(\mathcal W\)}

\begin{definition}[Structure of the WILL‐manifold]\label{def:will}
The WILL‐manifold \(\mathcal W\) is the set of all possible
energy–relation states, characterised by the following intrinsic
properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For any two systems \(S_1,S_2\) there exists a relational energy
          value \(E(S_1,S_2)\in\mathcal W\).
    \item The continuous evolution of these relations defines a
          \emph{flow} on \(\mathcal W\).
    \item This flow endows \(\mathcal W\) with a circular topology; continuity
          is defined by continuous energy transformations along that circle. \footnote{The circular topology will be justified in Section~4.1 via constancy of the universal rate of change.}
    \item Causality arises from the directional (orientable) character of
          the flow.
    \item Local “intensity’’ (density of relations) determines the
          effective metric properties experienced by observers. Importantly, these “metric properties’’ are emergent relational effects, not an underlying spacetime metric in the GR sense.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\noindent
Definition~\ref{def:will} is not subject to proof; it specifies the
ontological arena in which the subsequent \emph{WILL Closure Theorem}
is proved.

\section{Kinetic Energy}

\subsection{Reinterpretation of speed of light:}

We interpreting the \textbf{speed of light} $\textbf{c}$ as the \textbf{universal rate of change} implying that every energy transformation or interaction has the same rate = c distributed  between spatial like and temporal like components. We expressing \textbf{universal rate of change}\textbf{ c} as rotating radial vector so the unit circle naturally emerges as embodiment of conservation law. This choice is enforced by conservation of the fixed modulus $c$, forcing the endpoint to lie on the unit circle:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{$r=c = 1$} rotating radial vector on a unit circle controlled by:
    \item \textbf{$\theta_S = \arccos(\beta)$} relativistic angle represents energy distribution by rotation of radial vector.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
    \item  \textbf{$ \beta =  \frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{2r}} =  \cos(\theta_S), \quad \text{(Orbital velocity)}$} space like kinetic component ($X$axis) 
\end{itemize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item   $L_c =\sqrt{1-\beta^2} =\sin(\theta_S),\text{ (Length contraction factor)}$ temporal like component  ($Y$axis) 
        \item $T_d =\frac{1}{L_c}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2} }=\frac{1}{\sin(\theta_S)},\text{ (Time dilation factor)}$ identical to relativistic $\gamma$ factor.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[thick] (0,0) circle(1);
\draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (0.8,0) node[midway, below] {$\beta$};
\draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (0.8,0.6) node[above right] {$E$};
\draw[->, thick] (0.8,0) -- (0.8,0.6) node[midway, right] {$\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}$};
\end{tikzpicture}

In our model, the spatial and temporal-like projections are not to be interpreted as traditional coordinates, but as relative geometric ratios derived from the invariant rate of change. 

\subsection{Special Theory of Relativity (Time Dilation Factor)}

The standard time dilation factor in Special Relativity is given by $\beta = \frac{v}{c}$:

\begin{equation}
T_d = \frac{1}{L_c}= \frac{1}{\sin(\arccos(\beta))}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}=\gamma.
\end{equation}
\textbf{Conclusion:} The derived expression is identical to the standard time dilation factor $\gamma$, demonstrating the equivalence.

\subsection{Interpretation of \(\beta\): Spatial Energy Projection}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\beta$ (Beta): The kinetic projection, representing the ratio of an object's velocity to the universal speed of evolution.  \((v/c)\). It quantifies how much of the "speed of change" is perceived as motion through space relative to observer. Not an intrinsic property of an object but rather a measure of the differences between states, perceived from the perspective of an observer.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The range of \(\beta\) is naturally constrained: $0 \leq \beta \leq 1$.
Beyond \(\beta = 1\), the object moves faster than the speed at which causal signals propagate (speed of light in vacuum), and therefore becomes causally disconnected from the observer.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\beta$ quantifies the energy of an object or system as expressed in terms of the relative rate of change of spatial coordinates. Operationally, it reflects the amount of energy the observer would need to expend to "catch up" with the object.
\end{itemize}

\section{Geometric Derivation of \(E = mc^2\) Ab Initio}

In standard physics, this identity is often introduced via dynamical or conservation arguments.

\begin{theorem}
Within the WILL Geometry framework \(E = mc^2\) emerges purely from first principles of relational projections, without assuming any spacetime metric or pre-existing formula for rest energy.

\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}

\subsection*{Circular Projection and Relational Scale}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider a circle of radius \(c\).  Every point on this circle—parametrized by angle \(\theta_S\)—represents a possible distribution of “rate of change” between spatial and temporal components.
    \item Define \(\beta = \cos(\theta_S)\).  Then \(L_c=\sin(\theta_S) = \sqrt{1 - \beta^2}\).  Equivalently,
    \[
      \beta \;=\; \frac{v}{c}, 
      \quad 
      L_c \;=\;\sqrt{1 - \beta^2} \;=\; \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}.
    \]
This structure forms a right triangle in projection space:


\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]
  % Circle of radius 1
  \draw (0,0) circle (1);

  % Angle theta_S
  \draw[->] (0.3,0) arc (0:50:0.3) node[midway,right] {$\theta_S$};

  % Energy vector E

    node[above right] {$\mathbf{E}$};

  % Projections
  \draw[dashed] ({cos(50)}, {sin(50)}) -- ({cos(50)},0)
    node[midway,right] {$L_c$};
  \draw[dashed] ({cos(50)},0) -- (0,0)
    node[midway,below] {$\beta$};

  % Axis labels
  \draw[->] (-1.2,0) -- (1.2,0) node[right] {$\beta$};
  \draw[->] (0,-0.2) -- (0,1.2) node[above] {$L_c$};

  % Numeric labels (example)
  \node at (0.5,-0.05) {cos θₛ};
  \node at (-0.05,0.5) {sin θₛ};
\end{tikzpicture}


\noindent where the hypotenuse represents the total energy vector \( E \), geometrically arising from the projectional composition of motion and inertia.

    \item Introduce a single positive constant \(E_0\) (with units of energy) as the “minimal” or “reference” projection when \(\beta = 0\).  In other words, at \(\theta_S = \tfrac{\pi}{2}\) (i.e.\ \(v=0\)), the vertical projection of the total energy must be exactly \(E_0\).  Thus \(E_0\) is not assumed to equal \(mc^2\) yet; it simply sets the physical scale.
\end{itemize}

Accordingly, any point on the circle at angle \(\theta_S\) has two dimensionless coordinates:
\[
  (\cos(\theta_S),\;\sin(\theta_S)) 
  \;=\; \bigl(\beta,\;\   L_c\bigr).
\]
Multiply these by the same factor \(E\) (the total energy in physical units) to obtain physical projections:
$$
    E_x = E \cos\theta_S = E\beta, \quad E_y = E \sin\theta_S = E L_c.
    $$
    
By construction, when \(\beta=0\) (\(\theta_S=\tfrac{\pi}{2}\)), we require

\[
  E\,\sin\!\bigl(\tfrac{\pi}{2}\bigr) \;=\; E_0
  \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
  E_0 = E \cdot 1.
\]
So $E_0$ is:

$$
E_0 \equiv E L_c \quad \text{when } \beta=0.
$$
Vertical projection $E L_c$ remains equal to this same invariant $E_0$ for all values of $\beta$:
    $$
    E L_c = E_0 \quad \text{for all } \beta.
    $$
    
Solve for $E$:
    $$
    E = \frac{E_0}{L_c} = \frac{E_0}{\sin\theta_S}.
    $$
Using the identity $L_c = \sqrt{1-\beta^2}$, this becomes

\[
  E\,\sin(\theta_S) \;=\; E_0 
  \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
  E = \frac{E_0}{\sin(\theta_S)} \; =  \frac{E_0}{L_c} \; =\; \frac{E_0}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}.
\]
Define 
\[
  \gamma \;=\; T_d \;=\;\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}, 
  \quad
  \text{so that} 
  \quad
  E = \gamma\,E_0.
\]

\subsection*{Horizontal (Momentum) Projection}

In classical mechanics, momentum is \(p = m\,v\).  We have introduced neither \(m\) nor \(m\,c^2\) yet—only \(E_0\).  Observe:

\[
  E\,\cos(\theta_S) \;=\; E\,\beta 
  = \gamma\,E_0\,\beta.
\]
We identify the horizontal projection \(E\,\beta\) with \(p\,c\).  Thus
\[
  p\,c \;=\; \gamma\,E_0\,\beta.
\]
But since \(\beta = v/c\), this becomes 
\[
  p\,c = \gamma\,E_0\,\frac{v}{c}
  \;\;\Longrightarrow\;\;
  p = \frac{\gamma\,E_0}{c^2}\,v.
\]
At this stage, \(E_0\) remains an unspecified constant with dimensions of energy; the ratio \(E_0/c^2\) has the dimensions of mass.  Define
\[
  m \;\equiv\; \frac{E_0}{c^2}.
\]
\emph{(Here m is merely the dimensional coefficient linking the scale energy E₀ to the invariant c²)}

Hence 
\[
  E_0 = m\,c^2, 
  \quad
  p = \gamma\,m\,v, 
  \quad
  E = \gamma\,m\,c^2.
\]
Notice that no step assumed \(E_0 = m\,c^2\) as a given “rest-energy” formula; instead, we merely identified the combination \(E_0/c^2\) with a physical mass parameter \(m\).  The functional dependence on \(\gamma\) was already fixed by the circle’s geometry.

\subsection*{Pythagorean Relation and \(E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2\)}

Having
\[
  E\,\sin(\theta_S) = E_0 = m\,c^2, 
  \quad
  E\,\cos(\theta_S) = p\,c,
\]
the Pythagorean theorem in projection space yields
\[
  E^2 
  = \bigl(E\,\cos(\theta_S)\bigr)^{2} 
    + \bigl(E\,\sin(\theta_S)\bigr)^{2}
  = (p\,c)^2 + (m\,c^2)^2.
\]
Since \(E = \gamma\,m\,c^2\) and \(p = \gamma\,m\,v\), this recovers the standard relativistic energy–momentum relation:
\begin{equation}
    \boxed{E^2 = m^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Why Rest‐Energy Invariance Follows from Conservation}

Within the WILL framework, the total energy vector \(\mathbf{E}\) is represented by the hypotenuse of a right triangle inscribed in a unit circle of radius \(c\).  Its dimensionless projections satisfy
\[
  \beta = \cos\theta_S,\quad 
  L_c = \sin\theta_S,\quad 
  \beta^2 + L_c^2 = 1.
\]
When scaled by the physical magnitude \(E\), these become
\[
  E_x = E\,\cos\theta_S,\quad 
  E_y = E\,\sin\theta_S.
\]

To connect with the notion of “rest,” we operationally define the \emph{rest‐energy} \(E_0\) via the projection at zero spatial velocity (\(\beta=0,\;\theta_S=\tfrac\pi2\)):
\[
  E_y\bigl|_{\theta_S=\pi/2} 
  = E\,\sin\tfrac\pi2 
  = E_0.
\]
Because the circle’s Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2\theta_S + \sin^2\theta_S = 1\) holds for all \(\theta_S\), the only way to preserve \(E_y = E_0\) as \(\beta\) varies is
\[
  E\,\sin\theta_S = E_0 
  \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
  E = \frac{E_0}{\sin\theta_S}
    = \frac{E_0}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}
    = \gamma\,E_0.
\]

Hence, the rest‐energy projection's invariance is not an \emph{additional} axiom but the \emph{inevitable consequence} of:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The unit-circle geometry (\(\beta^2 + L_c^2 = 1\)),  
\item The operational choice to define "rest" as the slice \(\beta=0\),  
\item The conservation of that chosen projection \(E_y\).
\end{enumerate}

By anchoring this construction in our core postulate
\[
  \mathrm{SPACETIME} \;\equiv\; \mathrm{ENERGY\ EVOLUTION},
\]
we derive \(E = \gamma\,m\,c^2\) and \(E^2 = (p\,c)^2 + (m\,c^2)^2\) directly from geometry, with no need for extra hypotheses.


\subsection{Dual Scaling in WILL Geometry}

The WILL framework reveals a striking symmetry: both energy and spatial distance emerge from the same unit‐circle projections, differing only by the power of the inverse projection used.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Energy Scaling:}  
    The total energy \(E\) scales inversely with the temporal projection 
    \(L_c = \sin\theta_S\):
    \[
      E = \frac{E_0}{\sin\theta_S}
        = \frac{E_0}{L_c}
        = \gamma\,E_0,
    \]
    so that \(E\sin\theta_S = E_0\) remains invariant.

  \item \textbf{Distance Scaling:}  
    The (normalized) radial distance \(r/R_s\) in both Special and General Relativity scales inversely with the square of the spatial projection 
    \(\beta = \cos\theta_S\):
    \[
      \frac{r}{R_s}
      = \frac{1}{2\,\beta^2}
      = \frac{1}{2\,\cos^2\theta_S}.
    \]
\end{itemize}
\emph{(The distance scaling form is consistent with the later relation $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$ derived in Section~7.3.)}

In each case, a single dimensionless projection \((\sin\theta_S\) or \(\cos\theta_S)\) is elevated to a physical quantity by taking its reciprocal (to the appropriate power) and multiplying by a fixed scale (\(E_0\) or \(R_s/2\)).

\paragraph{Fundamental Implication}  
This duality underscores that at thFe deepest level, space, time, energy, and distance are all encoded in the same dimensionless geometry of the unit circle.  Any physical observable arises from choosing:

1.  A projection axis (\(\beta\) or \(L_c\)),  
2.  An inversion power (1 for energy, 2 for distance),  
3.  A conventional scale factor.  

Thus, the entire edifice of relativistic kinematics and gravity can be built from pure, dimensionless projections plus minimal scale conventions.```


\subsection{Mass as a Scale Factor}

In WILL geometry, mass is not an independent dynamical variable but simply
the conversion factor between the dimensionless “rest‐energy invariant”
\(E_0\) and familiar SI units.  Concretely:
\[
  m \;=\;\frac{E_0}{c^2}.
\]
Thus:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The rest‐energy projection \(E\,\sin\theta_S = E_0\)  
        can be equivalently written \(m\,c^2\).
  \item All inertial and gravitational effects (kinetic terms, Schwarzschild radius \(R_s\), etc.) follow by substituting \(E_0 = m\,c^2\) into the dual‐scaling laws.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Interpretation}

All relativistic properties—energy diverging as \(v \to c\), correct normalization at \(v=0\), and the conservation of energy–momentum—follow immediately.  In this framework:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The unit circle embodies the conservation of the “universal rate of change” \(c\).
  \item The parameter \(\beta = v/c\) specifies a point on that circle.
  \item A single scale \(E_0\) (later identified as \(m\,c^2\)) fixes the overall magnitude of the energy vector.
  \item No prior assumption of \(E = m\,c^2\) is needed; rather, it is recovered by operational choice to define "rest" as the vertical projection equal to \(E_0\) at \(\beta=0\).
\end{itemize}

Thus, \(E = \gamma\,m\,c^2\) and \(E^2 = (p\,c)^2 + (m\,c^2)^2\) are fully derived from the first principle that “energy evolution” is encoded in a self-contained circular geometry.

This geometric approach unifies our understanding of mass, energy, and momentum as different projections of the same fundamental quantity—the energy vector in WILL geometry—whose orientation is determined by the relative motion between observer and observed system.
\end{proof}

Standard GR is commonly interpreted through curvature; WILL instead treats geometry as emerging from energy relations, without positing curvature as a primitive explanatory layer 

Rather than imposing curvature as an interpretational construct, we allow the universe to naturally manifest its geometric structure through energy relations. This approach remains true to our foundational principle:

\begin{center}
\boxed{\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION}}
\end{center}

\subsection{Dimensional Correspondence of Energy Projections}

The WILL framework maps physical phenomena to geometric projections based on their inherent nature. This is not an arbitrary choice, but a \textbf{foundational correspondence}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Kinetic energy ($\beta$)} is fundamentally directional, describing motion along a path. Its natural representation within the framework is therefore a \textbf{1D projection}.
    \item \textbf{Gravitational potential ($\kappa$)} from a central mass is fundamentally isotropic, creating a spherically symmetric field. Its natural representation is therefore a \textbf{2D spherical projection}\footnote{Isotropy under the full rotation group SO(3) singles out the 2-sphere $S^2$ as the unique closed, maximally symmetric 2-manifold.}.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Boundary Conditions and Physical Interpretation}

For kinetic energy parameter $\beta$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\beta = 0$: No relative motion
    \item $\beta = 1$: Maximum relative motion, causal limit within one Energy system (speed of light)
\end{itemize}

By analogy, for the gravitational parameter $\kappa$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\kappa = 0$: No gravitational influence
    \item $\kappa = 1$: Maximum causal gravitational influence within one Energy system (event horizon)
\end{itemize}

The value $\kappa = 1$ corresponds precisely to the point where escape velocity equals the speed of light, creating an event horizon. This provides a natural causal limit for our gravitational parameter, analogous to the light-speed causal limit for relative motion.

Equivalent to our previous derivation of $\beta$ as kinetic energy component, now we can derive $\kappa$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  \textbf{$ \kappa =  \frac{v_e}{c} = \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{r}} =  \sin(\theta_G), \quad \text{(Escape velocity)}$}. time like potential component ($Y$axis) 
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{$\theta_G = \arcsin(\kappa)$} gravitational angle represents potential energy distribution.
\end{itemize}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item   $T_c =\sqrt{1-\kappa^2}=\sqrt{1-\frac{R_s}{r}}  =\cos(\theta_G)\text{ (Time contraction factor)}$ spatial like component  ($X$axis) 
        \item $L_d =\frac{1}{T_c}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\kappa^2} }=\frac{1}{\cos(\theta_G)}\text{ (Length dilation factor)}$.
    \end{itemize}
where $R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$

\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[thick] (0,0) circle(1);
\draw[-, thick] (0,0.8) -- (0.6,0.8) node[above, right] {$\sqrt{1 - \kappa^2}$};
\draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (0.6,0.8) node[midway, right] {$E$};
\draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (0,0.8) node[midway, left] {$\kappa$};
\end{tikzpicture}

\subsection{General Theory of Relativity (Schwarzschild radial length factor)}
The relevant component of the Schwarzschild metric, related to gravitational length dilation, is given by $\kappa^2 = \frac{R_s}{r}$:
\begin{equation}
L_d = \frac{1}{T_c}=\frac{1}{\cos(\arcsin(\kappa))}= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \kappa^2}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{R_s}{r}}}.
\end{equation}
\textbf{Conclusion:} The derived expression is identical to the relevant component of the Schwarzschild metric, demonstrating the equivalence.

\subsection{Interpretation of \(\kappa\): Temporal Energy Projection}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\kappa$ (Kappa): The potential projection. It measures how deeply an object is situated within a gravitational field, relative to an observer, and indicates proximity to an event horizon. Not an intrinsic property of an object but rather a measure of the differences between states, perceived from the perspective of an observer.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item This parameter quantifies the energy content of the object expressed through the relative rate of change of temporal coordinates. It characterizes how much energy the object would need to "escape" its local temporal curvature and synchronize its temporal coordinates with the observer.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The striking parallel between these parameters suggests a profound geometric connection between kinetic and potential energy within the WILL framework, which we shall now formalize mathematically:
\end{itemize}

\section{The Relational Nature of Energetic Projections}

The foundational principle that energy is not an intrinsic property possessed by an object, but a measure of the relational difference between observable states, must be fully internalized. When we remove observer-centric distortions, a clear and intuitive picture emerges: physical parameters do not belong to objects, but to the relations between them.

In this framework, the observer's state is, by definition, the origin of the measurement frame. All physical quantities describe the relational difference between an observed system and the observer's own state. This clarifies the true meaning of the projection parameters:

\begin{description}
    \item[\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\) (The Kinematic Projection):] This is not an intrinsic velocity of a target object. It is the measure of the relational difference between the observer and the object, projected onto the kinematic (directional) mode of energy evolution.
    \item[\(\boldsymbol{\kappa}\) (The Gravitational Projection):] This is not a measure of potential energy "stored" by an object. It is the measure of the object's state within a gravitational field, projected from the observer's relational position. It quantifies the 'depth' of a system within a potential, relative to the observer.
\end{description}

Energy is therefore the measure of a system's capacity to transition between states. The phrase "the object's energy" is always a shorthand for "the object's energy as measured in relation to an observer."

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Illustrative Analogy: The Relativity of Kinetic Energy]
An observer on a station platform measures a passing train to have significant kinetic energy. However, for an observer who is on the train, its kinetic energy relative to them is zero. The energy did not vanish; it was never an intrinsic property of the train. It was a property of the \textit{relation} between the train and the observer. By changing the observer's state (moving onto the train), the relation is redefined, and the corresponding energy projection becomes zero.
\end{tcolorbox}

Thus, energy and its geometric projections, \(\kappa\) and \(\beta\), are not hidden intrinsic attributes of systems but are the fundamental quantities of relational measurement. All of physics is a description of how systems differ from a chosen frame of reference.

\section{Fundamental Relation Between Potential and Kinetic Energy Projections}

\subsection{The Topological Necessity of \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) Projections}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title= \textbf{Important clarification:}]
These are not spatial objects, but abstract topological constructs encoding the conservation law and closure of energy relations. 
\end{tcolorbox}

The postulate \(\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION}\) is not a vague metaphor but a precise geometric constraint. It demands that all physical quantities emerge from the relational structure of transitions between observable states. This structure must be:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Self-contained:} There is no external background.
    \item \textbf{Conservative:} The total "resource" for evolution is fixed.
    \item \textbf{Maximally Symmetric:} No point or direction is privileged.
\end{enumerate}

These are not additional assumptions; they are the \textit{operational definitions} of what it means for spacetime to be identical to energy evolution. Any geometry violating these principles would reintroduce an absolute background, violating the postulate.

The fundamental question is: \textit{What are the unique geometric arenas that can host such a complete description of physical evolution?}

We must now characterize the types of "energy evolution" that constitute physics. There are two, and only two, fundamental classes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Class I (Directional Evolution):} This describes a transition whose character is defined by a \textit{preferred axis}. The act of measurement is the act of distinguishing this axis (e.g., the line connecting observer and object for relative velocity). The energy measure is inherently tied to a specific direction. This is the domain of kinematics.
    \item \textbf{Class II (Omnidirectional Evolution):} This describes a transition whose character is \textit{inherently without a preferred axis}. The act of measurement is the act of establishing a relation to a center, but the resulting field is defined equally in all directions from that center. This is the domain of a static, central potential.
\end{itemize}

These are not arbitrary choices. They are an exhaustive catalogue of the fundamental relational categories implied by the postulate. Class I isolates a single degree of freedom for measurement. Class II encompasses the full set of directional possibilities from a point.

The geometry must now accommodate these classes while obeying the three constraints above.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{For Class I (Directional):} The only closed, 1-dimensional manifold of constant positive curvature is the circle, \(S^1\). It is unique. It is maximally symmetric (all points and rotations are equivalent). It is self-contained and embodies conservation (the fixed radius). \textbf{Therefore, the kinematic parameter \(\beta\) must be a projection on \(S^1\). There is no other option.}
    \item \textbf{For Class II (Omnidirectional):} The only closed, simply-connected 2-dimensional manifold of constant positive curvature is the sphere, \(S^2\). It is unique. It is maximally symmetric (all points and rotational axes are equivalent). It is self-contained. \textbf{Therefore, the gravitational parameter \(\kappa\) must be a projection on \(S^2\). There is no other option.}
\end{itemize}

Closed, self-contained universe requires that the "total space of possibilities" for each projection mode be complete. The fundamental, dimensionless measure for the completeness of these geometries is their full angle:

\begin{itemize}
    \item For the circle ($S^1$), the total available "configurational space" is the full \textbf{planar angle}, measured as $2\pi$ \textbf{radians}.
    \item For the sphere ($S^2$), the total available "configurational space" is the full \textbf{solid angle}, measured as $4\pi$ \textbf{steradians}.
\end{itemize}

The ratio of the total angular measures of these two fundamental manifolds is a pure, dimensionless number dictated by their intrinsic topology:
\[
\frac{\text{Total Solid Angle (Sphere)}}{\text{Total Planar Angle (Circle)}} = \frac{4\pi \text{ sr}}{2\pi \text{ rad}} = 2
\]
This factor of 2 is a direct and necessary consequence of the dimensional difference between an omnidirectional (2D) and a linear (1D) projection space.

\begin{quote}\small
Here both $2\pi$ and $4\pi$ are the \emph{complete normalized angular measures} of $S^1$ and $S^2$. 
\textbf{Not spatial objects, but abstract topological constructs.}
Although planar and solid angles are defined in different dimensional settings, 
both are formally dimensionless in SI and serve as the natural measures of their respective closed symmetric manifolds. 
Thus their ratio is a pure number, reflecting the intrinsic topological difference between one- and two-dimensional projection spaces.
\end{quote}

\subsection{The Quadratic Nature of Energetic Projections}

To translate this purely geometric ratio into a physical law, we must consider how projections relate to energy. In physics, the energetic significance (or "power") of a field, velocity, or wave is proportional not to its amplitude, but to its \textbf{amplitude squared}. This quadratic relationship is fundamental, appearing in kinetic energy ($E_k \propto v^2$), potential energy in fields, and the energy density of electromagnetic waves ($E \propto A^2$).

Furthermore, in any projectional geometry, the magnitudes of orthogonal components are related to the whole via a Pythagorean sum of squares. Therefore, the conserved evolution resource is distributed among the squares of its projections. The fundamental relation must connect the ratio of the \textit{energetic significances} of the modes ($\kappa^2$ and $\beta^2$) to the underlying topological ratio of their geometric arenas.

This leads to the unique and necessary unification equation:
\[
\frac{\kappa^2}{\beta^2} = 2 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \boxed{\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2}
\]

\paragraph{Important Clarification.}
This factor of 2 is not an empirical constant, a Newtonian mechanical result, or a coincidence of orbital dynamics. It is a direct consequence of the ratio of the fundamental angular measures (steradians to radians) that define the complete projection spaces for omnidirectional and linear phenomena.

\paragraph{Closure Condition.}
The relation $\kappa^2=2\beta^2$ is therefore more than a proportionality: it is the precise criterion for energetic closure. Whenever the equality is satisfied, the system under study is fully self-contained, with no leakage of the conserved resource into unaccounted channels. Whenever the equality \emph{appears} to fail (for instance in highly elliptical binaries or in radiating systems), this does not contradict the principle but indicates that additional energy pathways --- such as gravitational-wave emission or cosmological expansion --- must be included to restore the balance. In this sense, the relation acts as a diagnostic invariant: it tells us whether our description has captured the full closed geometry or whether unseen flows remain.

\subsection{Closure, Falsifiability, and the Conservation of Energy}

The relation $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$ must be understood not merely as a proportionality, but as the precise geometric criterion for the \textbf{energetic closure} of a system. In this framework, it serves as the direct geometric embodiment of the Law of Conservation of Energy.

Any apparent deviation from this equality is therefore not a failure of the principle. Instead, it acts as a powerful diagnostic tool that presents a definitive epistemic choice:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The System is Incompletely Defined:} The observer has failed to account for all energy channels. The deviation is a physical signature of an unaccounted-for process (e.g., gravitational-wave emission, mass accretion, or other energy flows). The relation thus becomes a predictive instrument, compelling the discovery of these flows to restore the geometric balance.

    \item \textbf{A Violation of Fundamental Conservation:} If, hypothetically, a system were proven to be perfectly closed with all energy flows rigorously accounted for, and the relation $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$ was still systematically violated, this would imply a failure of the Law of Conservation of Energy itself.
\end{enumerate}.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=The Principle as a Diagnostic Invariant]
The relation $\boxed{\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2}$ holds if and only if the system under study is energetically closed. An apparent violation is not a contradiction of the theory, but a physical prediction that energy is flowing through an unaccounted-for channel. The principle is therefore falsifiable, with its falsification being equivalent to demonstrating a violation of energy conservation.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{Illustrative Examples}

To clarify the meaning of this closure condition, consider two contrasting cases:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Circular Orbit (Closed Subsystem).}  
    For a test body in a perfectly circular orbit around a central mass, the condition $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$ is exactly fulfilled. The orbital system can be treated as energetically closed: all of the conserved resource is accounted for between the kinetic projection along the orbit and the gravitational projection toward the center. No external channels are needed, and the equality signals full closure.

    \item \textbf{Radiating Binary (Open Subsystem).}  
    In contrast, for a highly elliptical binary system of compact objects (such as neutron stars. (full calculation in section: Empirical Validation; subsection: Orbital Decay: Binary Pulsar)), the orbital evolution is accompanied by gravitational-wave emission. If one considers only the orbital mechanics, the relation $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$ will appear to be violated. Yet this is not a failure of the principle. Instead, it reveals that the subsystem is not closed: part of the resource leaves through radiation. When the gravitational-wave channel is included in the balance, the closure is restored and the equality holds again.
\end{itemize}

These examples highlight the diagnostic role of the relation: it identifies whether the chosen subsystem is complete, or whether additional flows of the evolution resource must be incorporated to recover closure.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Principle of Closure.}  
The relation $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$ holds if and only if the system under consideration is fully closed, with no leakage of energy into channels not included in the description.
\end{quote}

The factor of 2 in the fundamental relation \(\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2\)  is the ratio of the total solid angle of the sphere (\(4\pi\) steradians) to the total planar angle of the circle (\(2\pi\) radians). This ratio is the geometric exchange rate between the two unique manifolds that host the two fundamental categories of energy evolution.

\vspace{1em}
\noindent\textbf{In summary:} 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The postulate defines the universe as a closed, conservative, symmetric relational structure.
    \item The physical content of that universe consists of two and only two fundamental types of relations: directional and omnidirectional.
    \item The mathematics of geometry dictates that the \textit{only} closed, maximally symmetric arenas for these relations are \(S^1\) and \(S^2\), respectively.
    \item Therefore, the projection parameters \(\beta\) and \(\kappa\) are \textit{forced} to live on these \textbf{non-spatial} manifolds.
\end{enumerate}

It is the \textit{only geometrical content} that can be housed within the geometric constrains dictated by the fundamental postulate.

\paragraph{Physical Implication.}
In WILL Geometry, this relation is foundational. It links gravitational and kinetic modes without reference to spacetime as a background fabric, showing that their connection is a matter of geometric and topological necessity, not dynamic coincidence. Classical physics, in its successful predictions, unknowingly traces the consequences of this deeper geometric law.

\[
\boxed{\text{Spacetime Geometry (}\kappa^{2}\text{)} \;\equiv\; \text{Kinematic Energy distribution (}\beta^{2}\text{)}\;\times\;2}
\]
\[
\boxed{\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION}}
\]

\subsection{Geometric Relationships}

The relativistic and gravitational factors can be expressed in unified algebraic and trigonometric forms, as shown in Table 1.

\begin{table}[h]

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\(\theta_S = \arccos(\beta),\quad \theta_G = \arcsin(\kappa)\)}\\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Unified representation of relativistic and gravitational effects.}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{The Combined Energy Parameter $Q$}

The total energy projection parameter unifies both aspects:

\begin{align}
    Q &=\sqrt{\kappa^2 + \beta^2}  \\
    Q^{2}&= 3\beta^2 = \frac{3}{2}\kappa^2 = \frac{3R_s}{2r_{d}} \\
    Q_t &= \sqrt{1-Q^2} = \sqrt{1-\kappa^2-\beta^2} = \sqrt{1-3\beta^2} = \sqrt{1-\frac{3}{2}\kappa^2} \\
    Q_r &= \frac{1}{Q_t}
\end{align}

These describe the combined effects of relativity and gravity.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Unified Interpretation]
The familiar SR and GR factors emerge here as projections of the same conserved geometry. 
Relativistic ($\beta$) and gravitational ($\kappa$) modes are not separate “effects” but dual aspects of one energy-evolution constraint revealing their unified origin.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Energy–Symmetry Law}\label{sec:energy-symmetry}

\subsection{Causal Continuity and Energy Symmetry}
\begin{theorem}[Energy Symmetry]
The energy differences perceived by two observers at different positions balance according to the Energy–Symmetry Law:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Consider two observers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Observer $A$ at rest on the surface at radius $r_A$.
\item Observer $B$ orbiting at radius $r_B > r_A$ with orbital velocity $v_B$.
\end{itemize}
Each observer perceives energy transfers differently due to gravitational and kinetic differences:
From $A$'s perspective (surface → orbit):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Object gains potential energy by moving away from gravitational center.
\item Object gains kinetic energy by accelerating to orbital velocity.
\end{enumerate}
This results in energy difference:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\Delta E_{A \to B} = \frac{1}{2}\left((\kappa_A^2 - \kappa_B^2) + \beta_B^2\right)}
\end{equation}
From $B$'s perspective (orbit → surface):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Object loses gravitational potential energy descending into stronger gravitational field.
\item Object loses kinetic energy by reducing velocity from orbital speed to rest.
\end{enumerate}
This results in energy difference:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\Delta E_{B \to A} = \frac{1}{2}\left((\kappa_B^2 - \kappa_A^2) - \beta_B^2\right)}
\end{equation}
Summing these transfers:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0
\end{equation}
Thus, no net energy is created or destroyed, confirming the Energy–Symmetry Law.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Observer-Agnostic Symmetry}
\begin{theorem}[Observer-Agnostic Energy Symmetry]
The Energy–Symmetry Law holds true independent of the specific model of gravitational or kinetic energy:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0 \quad \forall f(v)
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Regardless of the chosen energy function $f(v)$ representing kinetic or gravitational energy differences, consistency demands that:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0.
\end{equation}
The crucial point is mutual consistency, not specific energy definitions.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Physical Meaning of Factor $\frac{1}{2}$}

The factor $\frac{1}{2}$ does not originate from classical mechanics, but from the geometric nature of the quadratic form that measures the ``evolution budget'' $Q^2 = \kappa^2 + \beta^2$. 

When comparing two nearby states, the change in this quadratic form is
\[
\delta Q^2 = (\kappa_2^2 - \kappa_1^2) + (\beta_2^2 - \beta_1^2).
\]
In energetic terms, only \emph{half} of this variation is attributed to the ``active'' transfer in one direction, because the other half belongs to the reciprocal change seen from the opposite frame. This division is the same geometric reason why kinetic energy in classical mechanics is $K = \frac12 m v^2$: the quadratic metric is naturally paired with a factor $\frac12$ when representing stored or exchanged energy.

Thus:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gravitational potential term: $U \propto -\frac{1}{2}\kappa^2$.
\item Kinetic term: $K \propto \frac{1}{2}\beta^2$.
\end{itemize}
The $\frac12$ reflects the symmetric partition of a quadratic budget between mutually consistent perspectives, not an externally imposed convention.

\subsection{Universal Speed Limit as Consequence of Energy Symmetry}
\begin{theorem}[Universal Speed Limit]
The universal speed limit ($v \leq c$) emerges naturally from Energy–Symmetry conditions.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Assume an object could exceed the speed of light ($\beta > 1$). In that scenario:
\begin{itemize}
\item The kinetic component ($\beta^2$) surpasses unity excessively, causing an irreversible imbalance in energy transfer.
\item No reciprocal transfer could balance this energy, breaking the fundamental symmetry:
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} \neq 0
\end{equation}
Thus, $\beta \leq 1$ ($v \leq c$) is required intrinsically to preserve causal and energetic consistency.
\end{proof}
In essence, WILL Geometry encodes the principle that:
\begin{quote}
The speed of light is the boundary beyond which the energetic symmetry between perspectives breaks down. Causality is not an external rule but a built-in feature of the universe's energetic geometry.
\end{quote}

\section{Classical Keplerian Energy as a WILL--Minkowski Projection}

A striking consequence of the Energy--Symmetry Law is that, when the
zero of gravitational potential is chosen on the surface of the central body
rather than at infinity, the total specific orbital energy (potential $+$ kinetic,
per unit mass) naturally appears in \emph{Minkowski form}.

\subsection{Classical Result with Surface Reference}

For a test body of mass $m$ on a circular orbit of radius $a$ about
a central mass $M_\oplus$ (Earth in our example),
classical Newtonian mechanics gives:
\begin{align}
\Delta U &= -\frac{GM_\oplus m}{a} + \frac{GM_\oplus m}{R_\oplus},\\
K &= \frac12 m\frac{GM_\oplus}{a}.
\end{align}
Adding these and dividing by the rest--energy $E_0 = m c^2$ yields
the dimensionless total:
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{\text{tot}}}{E_0}
= \frac{GM_\oplus}{R_\oplus c^2}
 - \frac12\frac{GM_\oplus}{a c^2}.
\label{eq:classical_surface}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Projection Parameters and Minkowski Form}

Define the WILL projection parameters for the surface and the orbit:
\begin{align}
\kappa_\oplus^2 &\equiv \frac{2GM_\oplus}{R_\oplus c^2},\\
\beta_{\text{orbit}}^2 &\equiv \frac{GM_\oplus}{a c^2}.
\end{align}
Substituting into \eqref{eq:classical_surface} gives the exact identity:
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{\text{tot}}}{E_0}
= \frac12\bigl(\kappa_\oplus^2 - \beta_{\text{orbit}}^2\bigr).
\label{eq:will_minkowski_energy}
\end{equation}

This is already in the form of a \emph{hyperbolic difference of squares}:
if we set $x \equiv \kappa_\oplus$ and $y \equiv \beta_{\text{orbit}}$, then
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{\text{tot}}}{E_0} = \frac12\,(x^2 - y^2),
\end{equation}
which is structurally identical to a Minkowski interval in $(1+1)$ dimensions,
up to the constant factor $\frac12$.

\subsection{Physical Interpretation}

In classical derivations, \eqref{eq:classical_surface} is just the sum
$\Delta U + K$ with a particular choice of potential zero.
In the WILL framework, \eqref{eq:will_minkowski_energy} emerges directly from the
energy--symmetry relation:
\[
\Delta E_{A\to B}
= \frac12\bigl((\kappa_A^2 - \kappa_B^2) + \beta_B^2\bigr),
\]
with $(A,B) = (\text{surface},\ \text{orbit})$,
and is \emph{invariantly} expressible as a difference of squared projections.

This shows that the Keplerian total energy is not an isolated Newtonian
artifact but a special case of a deeper geometric structure: the Minkowski--type
projection algebra of WILL Geometry.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Why This Matters]
\begin{itemize}
\item In classical form, the total orbital energy per unit mass depends only on
$GM$ and $a$, and is independent of the test--mass $m$.
\item In WILL form, the same fact is embedded in a Lorentz--like difference
of squared projections, with no need for separate ``gravitational'' and
``kinetic'' constructs.
\item This reframing answers \emph{why} the Keplerian combination appears:
it is enforced by the underlying geometry of energy evolution.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}


\section{Derivation of Density, Mass, and Pressure}

\subsection{Geometric Foundation}
From the projective analysis established in the previous sections, the fundamental invariant is
\[
\kappa^2 = \frac{R_s}{r_d},
\]
where $\kappa$ emerges from the energy projection on the unit circle, and $R_s = 2Gm_0/c^2$ links to the mass scale factor $m_0 = E_0/c^2$.

\subsection{Derivation of Energy Density}

\paragraph{From Mass Scale to Volumetric Potential.}
Starting from the geometric relation,
\[
m_0 = \frac{\kappa^2 c^2 r_d}{2G},
\]
we associate $m_0$ with a volumetric proxy $r_d^3$, obtaining a raw volumetric potential,
\[
\frac{m_0}{r_d^3} = \frac{\kappa^2 c^2}{2G r_d^2}.
\]

\paragraph{Applying the Geometric Distribution Principle.}
Because the potential projection $\kappa$ is fundamentally associated with a 2D spherical manifold, the volumetric expression must be normalized over the unit-sphere area $4\pi$. This yields the physical energy density,
\[
\rho = \frac{1}{4\pi}\left(\frac{\kappa^2 c^2}{2G r_d^2}\right) 
= \frac{\kappa^2 c^2}{8\pi G r_d^2}.
\]

\paragraph{Maximal Density.}
At $\kappa^2 = R_s/r_d = 1$, the horizon condition is reached, corresponding to the maximal observable energy density at radius $r_d$:
\[
\rho_{\max} = \frac{c^2}{8\pi G r_d^2}.
\]
\paragraph{Normalized Relation.}
Thus the fundamental identification is
\[
\boxed{\;\kappa^2 = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{\max}} \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; \kappa^2 \equiv \Omega\;}.
\]

\subsection{Self-Consistency Requirement}

The mass scale factor can be expressed in two equivalent ways.

From the geometric definition:
\[
m_0 = \frac{\kappa^2 c^2 r_d}{2G}.
\]

From the energy density:
\[
m_0 = \alpha \, r_d^n \, \rho.
\]

Substituting $\rho = \frac{\kappa^2 c^2}{8\pi G r_{d}^2}$ into $m_0 = \alpha \, r_d^n \, \rho$ gives
\[
m_0 = \frac{\alpha \kappa^2 c^2 r_d^{n-2}}{8\pi G}.
\]

Equating the two forms:
\[
\frac{\alpha r_d^{n-2}}{8\pi} = \frac{r_d}{2}.
\]

Radius independence requires $n=3$, yielding $\alpha=4\pi$. Hence,
\[
m_0 = 4\pi r_d^3 \rho,
\]
which closes the consistency loop between the geometric and density-based formulations.

\subsection{Pressure as Surface Curvature Gradient}

In the WILL framework pressure is not a thermodynamic assumption but the direct consequence of curvature gradients.  
The radial balance relation gives
\[
P(r) \;=\; \frac{c^4}{8\pi G}\,\frac{1}{r}\,\frac{d\kappa^2}{dr}.
\]

Using $\kappa^2 = R_s/r$, one finds $d\kappa^2/dr = -\kappa^2/r$, hence
\[
P(r) \;=\; -\,\frac{\kappa^2 c^4}{8\pi G r^2}.
\]

Since the local energy density is
\[
\rho(r) \;=\; \frac{\kappa^2 c^2}{8\pi G r^2},
\]
this yields the invariant equation of state
\[
\boxed{\,P(r) = -\,\rho(r)\,c^2\,}.
\]

\paragraph{Interpretation.}
$P$ is a surface-like negative pressure (isotropic tension), not a bulk volume pressure.  
It expresses the resistance of energy–geometry itself to changes in projection.  

\paragraph{Consistency.}
If one formally freezes the projection parameter ($d\kappa^2/dr=0$), then $P=0$.  
But in this case the angular curvature terms remain uncompensated, and the field equation is no longer satisfied.  
Any nontrivial radial dependence of $\kappa$ inevitably generates the negative tension 
\[
P = -\rho c^2,
\]
which precisely cancels the residual curvature.  
Thus the negative pressure is not optional but a necessary ingredient for full self-consistency.

\paragraph{Maximum pressure.}
At the geometric bound $\kappa^2=1$ (horizon condition), the density saturates at
\[
\rho_{\max} = \frac{c^2}{8\pi G r^2},
\]
and the corresponding pressure is
\[
P_{\max} = -\,\rho_{\max}\,c^2 \;=\; -\,\frac{c^4}{8\pi G r^2}.
\]
This negative surface pressure represents the ultimate tension limit of spacetime fabric at a given scale $r$.

\begin{center}
\boxed{\text{Pressure in WILL is the intrinsic surface tension of energy–geometry, saturating at $P_{\max}=-c^4/(8\pi G r^2)$.}}
\end{center}

\section{Unified Geometric Field Equation}

\subsection{The Fundamental Equation}
From the energy-geometry equivalence, the complete description of gravitational phenomena reduces to a single algebraic relation:

\begin{equation}
\boxed{
\kappa^2 = \frac{R_s}{r_{d}} = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{max}}
}
\label{eq:unified_field}
\end{equation}
                                        \textbf{The ratio of geometric scales equals the ratio of energy densities.}\\

This is the unified geometric field equation of WILL Geometry. It expresses the complete equivalence:
\[
\text{GEOMETRY} \equiv \text{ENERGY DISTRIBUTION}
\]

.\begin{figure}[h!]

 \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/Theoretical-Ouroboros-min.jpg}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Meaning]
\[
\textbf{Energy is not “inside” space — it defines space through projection.}
\]
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Contrast with Classical Approaches}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Surface–scaled closure (vs.\ volume filling).} 
Mass follows the algebraic closure $m_0=4\pi r_d^3\rho$ with $\rho=\kappa^2 c^2/(8\pi G r_d^2)$; the $4\pi$ is the spherical projection measure, not a Newtonian volume average.

\item \textbf{Algebraic core (vs.\ differential ansatz).}
The core invariants are algebraic and coordinate-free. Differential relations appear only as auxiliary scaffolding (e.g.\ to express curvature gradients as $P=-\rho c^2$), not as fundamental inputs.

\item \textbf{Natural bounds.}
The constraint for non rotating systems $\kappa^2\le 1$ enforces $\rho\le\rho_{\max}$ and $|P|\le |P_{\max}|=c^4/(8\pi G r_d^2)$, avoiding singularities without extra hypotheses.
\end{itemize}



\section{The Fundamental Invariant $W_{\text{ill}} = 1$}

From the geometric closure of WILL framework, we derive a universal dimensionless invariant:

\begin{equation}
W_{ill} = \frac{E \cdot T^2}{M \cdot L^2} = \frac{L_d E_0 T_c t^2_{d}}{T_d m_0 L_c r^2_{d}} = 1
\end{equation}

\textbf{Proof:} Substituting the geometric definitions:
\begin{align}
W_{\text{ill}} &= \frac{\frac{1}{\cos \theta_G}\ m_0c^2 \cos \theta_G \frac{r^2_{d}}{c^2}}{\frac{1}{\sin\theta_S}\ m_0 \sin\theta_S r^2_{d}} = \frac{m_0c^2 r^2_{d}}{c^2} \cdot \frac{\sin\theta_S}{m_0 r^2_{d}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin\theta_S} = 1
\end{align}

This invariant holds universally for all values of $m_0$, $G$, $c$, and $\kappa$. Unlike dimensional analysis, this identity emerges from the projectional interdependence of energy-mass $(E,M)$ and spacetime metrics $(T,L)$ within the unified structure.

\[
\boxed{\text{The invariant } W_{\text{ill}} = 1 \text{ expresses geometric unity through energetic projection}}
\]

\subsection{The Name "WILL"}
The name WILL reflects both the harmonious unity of the equation and a subtle irony towards the anthropic principle, which often intertwines human existence with the causality of the universe. The equation stands as a testament to the universal laws of physics, transcending any anthropocentric framework.


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=WILL]
\[
\boxed{
\textbf{It is not the unit of something—it is the unity of everything.}
}
\]
\end{tcolorbox}


\section{Geometric Kerr–Newman Metric in the WILL Framework  (Space ⊗ Time ⊗ Energy)}

\subsection{The Principle of Energetic Closure and Contextual Bounds}

The framework establishes a clear hierarchy of principles. The supreme invariant is the \textbf{Law of Conservation of Energy}. The equation $\boxed{\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2}$ is the direct geometric embodiment of this law, acting as the precise criterion for the \textbf{energetic closure} of a system.

This means the equality holds if, and only if, all energy flows have been fully accounted for. The different numerical limits on the projection parameters are not different rules, but are necessary \textbf{consequences} of applying this single, universal criterion of closure to different physical boundary conditions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{For a gravitationally closed (static) system,} the physical boundary is defined by the condition $\kappa^2 = 1$. The closure principle ($\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$) is what dictates that this corresponds to a kinetic state of $\beta^2 = 1/2$.
    \item \textbf{For a kinematically closed (maximally rotating) system,} the physical boundary is defined by the condition $\beta^2 = 1$. The same closure principle ($\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$) then necessitates that the corresponding gravitational state must be $\kappa^2 = 2$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Analogy: The Engine's Redline]
A car engine's fundamental physical limit is its RPM redline (e.g., 6,000 RPM)—this is analogous to the Law of Conservation of Energy. The equation relating speed to RPM is fixed for each gear—this is the diagnostic tool, analogous to $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$. The observable maximum speed is a consequence, not a fundamental rule in itself: it might be 40 km/h in first gear and 180 km/h in fifth. It is not a contradiction to have different speed limits; it is the result of applying the same engine-and-gear relationship to different boundary conditions.
\end{tcolorbox}

Thus, the framework maintains a single, consistent principle of closure. Its geometric expression, $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$, yields different numerical bounds depending on whether the system's boundary is defined by its gravitational or its kinematic limit.

For rotating black holes, we establish the connection between these parameters and the Kerr metric by defining:

\[
\beta =\frac{a c}{G m_0}, \quad \kappa = \sqrt{2} \beta
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\beta\) is the rotation parameter, with \(0 \leq \beta \leq 1\),
    \item \(\kappa\) is related to the geometry and rotation,
    \item \(R_s = \frac{2 G m_0}{c^2}\) is the Schwarzschild radius,
    \item \(a = \frac{J}{m_0 c}\) is the Kerr rotation parameter,
    \item \(J\) is the angular momentum of the black hole,
    \item \(m_0\) is the mass of the black hole.
\end{itemize}

We also derive a key invariant relationship:

\[
a_{\max} = \frac{G m_0}{c^2} = \frac{R_s}{2} =\beta_{\max}^2  r_{d}
\]

This relationship holds when \(r_{d} = \frac{R_s}{2 \beta^2}\), providing an elegant connection between the parameters.

\subsection{Event Horizon}
Using our approach, the inner and outer event horizons of the Kerr metric are expressed as:

\[
r_{\pm} = \frac{R_s}{2} \left(1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \beta^2}\right)
\]

For the extreme case where \(\beta = 1\) (maximal rotation), the horizons merge at:

\[
r_{+} = r_{-} = \frac{R_s}{2}
\]

This coincides with the minimum radius in our model predicted using maximum value of $\kappa$ parameter $\kappa_{max}=\sqrt{2}$:

\[
r_{\min} = \frac{1}{\kappa_{max}^2} R_s = \frac{1}{2} R_s
\]

\subsection{Ergosphere}
The radius of the ergosphere in our model is described as:

\[
r_{\text{ergo}} = \frac{R_s}{2} \left(1 + \sqrt{1 - \beta^2 \cos^2 \theta}\right)
\]

This formulation correctly reproduces the key features of the ergosphere:
\begin{itemize}
    \item At the equator (\(\theta = \pi / 2\)), \(r_{\text{ergo}} = R_s\) for any rotation parameter,
    \item At the poles (\(\theta = 0\)), \(r_{\text{ergo}}\) coincides with the event horizon radius.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ring Singularity}
Unlike the Schwarzschild metric with its point singularity, the Kerr metric features a ring singularity located at:
\[
r = 0, \quad \theta = \frac{\pi}{2}
\]
The "size" of this ring is proportional to \(a = \frac{G m_0}{c} \beta\), reaching its maximum for extreme black holes (\(\beta = 1\)).

\subsection{Naked Singularity}
For \(\beta \leq 1\), a naked singularity does not emerge, aligning with the cosmic censorship hypothesis. In our model, we maintain this physical constraint by limiting \(\beta\) to the range \([0, 1]\).

\subsection{The Relationship Between \(\kappa > 1\) and Rotation}
For extreme rotation (\(\beta = 1\)), we find \(\kappa = \sqrt{2} > 1\), which reflects the displacement of the event horizon and the geometric properties of rotating black holes. This suggests that values of \(\kappa > 1\) are inherently connected to the physics of rotation in spacetime.

\subsection{Physical and Philosophical Interpretation}
The identification of the dimensionless rotation parameter \(a_* = \frac{c J}{G m_0^2}\) with \(\beta\) reveals a profound connection between the intrinsic rotation of the black hole and the orbital velocity of objects in its vicinity. In our model, \(\beta = \frac{a c}{G m_0}\), and when equated to \(a_*\), it implies:
\[
a_* = \beta
\]
This equivalence suggests that the rotation of a black hole can be understood through geometric parameters analogous to orbital mechanics. Physically, it indicates that the rotational properties of the black hole, encapsulated in \(a_*\), mirror the orbital velocity parameter \(\beta\), providing a unified description of spacetime dynamics.

Philosophically, this reinforces the notion that gravitational phenomena, including rotation, are manifestations of the underlying geometry of the universe. The absence of additional "material" parameters underscores the elegance of general relativity, where the curvature of spacetime alone dictates the behavior of massive rotating objects. This geometric interpretation bridges the gap between the abstract mathematics of the Kerr metric and the intuitive physics of orbital motion, offering a deeper insight into the nature of spacetime.

\subsection{Conclusion}
Our approach successfully describes the Kerr metric through the parameters \(\beta\) and \(\kappa\), demonstrating the elegance of geometric methods in studying spacetime. This framework provides a more intuitive understanding of rotating black holes while preserving the essential mathematical structure of general relativity.


\subsection*{Physical Interpretation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{No need for pre-existing spacetime} — geometry emerges from angular energy distributions.
  \item \textbf{All parameters} are dimensionless and directly derived from the speed of light as finite resource.
  \item \textbf{Scale invariance:} The same structure applies from Planck-scale objects to galactic black holes.
\end{itemize}

\section{Resolution of Singularities in Static and Rotating Spacetimes}

In General Relativity, gravitational singularities represent points or regions where curvature invariants such as the Kretschmann scalar diverge, typically arising when energy density \( \rho \to \infty \) as \( r \to 0 \). These singularities are considered a breakdown of the theory’s predictive power, signaling the need for a quantum theory of gravity or new boundary conditions. WILL Geometry, by contrast, resolves the singularity problem from within its geometric foundation.

\subsection*{1. Singularity Prevention in Static Systems}

In spherically symmetric, non-rotating systems, WILL Geometry establishes that energy density cannot exceed the local critical density:

\[
\rho(r_{d}) \leq \rho_{\text{max}}(r_{d}) = \frac{c^2}{8\pi G r_{d}^2}
\]

The curvature parameter \( \kappa^2 = \rho / \rho_{\text{max}} \) is strictly bounded by \( \kappa^2 \leq 1 \), and this upper bound is realized precisely when:

\[
r_{d}= R_s = \frac{2Gm_0}{c^2}
\]

At this radius, the system reaches maximal curvature, and any attempt to compress further would violate the geometric constraints of the framework. Importantly, since \( \kappa^2 > 1 \) is undefined, configurations with \( r < R_s \) are not permitted within the projectional structure of WILL Geometry. There is no infinite curvature—rather, geometry saturates.

\subsection*{2. Lower Bound on Radius and Finite Structure}

In the classical Schwarzschild solution, the limit \( r \to 0 \) leads to divergent curvature scalars. In WILL Geometry, however, this limit is physically excluded. All valid configurations must satisfy:

\[
r_{d} \geq R_s \quad \text{and} \quad \kappa^2 \leq 1
\]

Thus, the interior \( r < R_s \) is not a region with hidden or pathological physics—it is a region without geometric projection, and therefore does not exist in the physical structure. The concept of "inside the Schwarzschild radius" is replaced by a geometrically complete, self-contained surface of maximal curvature.

\subsection*{3. Rotating Systems and Extension to Kerr Geometry}

The same principle naturally extends to rotating black holes. In WILL Geometry, rotation is described by the dimensionless parameter \( \beta = \frac{ac^2}{Gm_0} \), where \( a = J / (m_0 c) \) is the classical Kerr spin parameter. The rotational curvature parameter is then:

\[
\kappa = \sqrt{2} \beta
\]

This leads to a maximum value \( \kappa_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{2} \), corresponding to \( \beta = 1 \). The minimal geometrically allowed radius becomes:

\[
r_{\text{min}} = \frac{R_s}{\kappa_{\text{max}}^2} = \frac{R_s}{2}
\]

This coincides precisely with the extremal Kerr horizon, where \( r_+ = r_- = R_s / 2 \), and demonstrates that the classical ring singularity at \( r = 0, \theta = \pi/2 \) is never reached in the geometric projection. Instead, the structure terminates at \( r = R_s / 2 \), a finite and well-defined boundary of maximal rotational curvature.

\subsection*{4. No Singularities, No Hidden Regions}

This framework introduces no interior singularities, no coordinate patches hidden behind horizons, and no ambiguous initial conditions. The geometric field equation:

\[
\frac{R_{s}}{r_{d}}=\frac{8\pi G}{c^{2}}r_{d}^{2}\ \rho=\kappa^{2}
\]

ensures that curvature and energy density evolve smoothly and remain bounded across all observable scales.

\subsection*{Conclusion}

WILL Geometry resolves the singularity problem not by regularizing divergent terms, nor by introducing quantum effects, but by geometrically constraining the domain of valid projections. Curvature is always finite, and energy remains bounded by construction. Black holes become energetically saturated but nonsingular regions, described entirely by finite, dimensionless parameters.

This projectional approach provides a clean, intrinsic termination to gravitational collapse, replacing singular endpoints with structured, maximally curved boundaries.

\subsection*{Foundational Clarification}

This curvature-density equivalence is not an additional postulate, but emerges directly and unavoidably from the single foundational postulate:
\[
\boxed{\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION}}
\]
All the derived relations for local energy density, pressure, enclosed mass, and horizon formation are purely logical and mathematical consequences of this unique guiding principle. In this sense, the WILL Geometry framework achieves absolute epistemological cleanliness: it does not introduce any hidden assumptions or coordinate structures. The entire gravitational and relativistic sector (as reconstructed within the WILL Geometry model, from the single postulate without any external assumptions or coordinate backgrounds ) — including precise predictions about the onset of horizon formation, radial pressure gradients, and the resolution of classical singularity issues—is reconstructed from this single postulate.

\section{Beyond Differential Formalism: Structural Dynamics}

\subsection{Intrinsic Dynamics via Energy Redistribution}


The system is not described by differential equations of motion evolving \textit{in} time. Instead, its evolution is dictated by a closed network of algebraic relations that enforce a perpetually balanced configuration. Any change in one parameter necessitates a coordinated shift in all others to maintain geometric self-consistency. What we perceive as "dynamics" is this ordered succession of balanced states. The framework thus inverts the classical paradigm: 

The foundation of WILL Geometry lies in the principle that spacetime geometry is fully determined by the distribution of energy, parameterized by the dimensionless quantities \(\beta\) and \(\kappa\). Any change in the system's energy—due to mass variation, motion, or redistribution—directly reshapes the geometry. This intrinsic linkage ensures that dynamics is embedded within the model itself, without requiring external equations of motion.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!40!black,title=This reveals a fundamental inversion of the classical paradigm:]
 \textbf{Time does not drive change — instead, change defines time.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{Why There Are No Equations of Motion}

In classical and relativistic physics, dynamics is formulated through differential equations.  
These express how physical quantities evolve continuously through time, typically governed by:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A temporal parameter $t$,
    \item A Lagrangian function $L$,
    \item A variational principle: $\delta S = 0$, where $S = \int L\,dt$,
    \item Euler–Lagrange equations that yield the system’s path.
\end{itemize}

This framework assumes:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A continuum of possible configurations,
    \item That Nature selects one by minimizing action,
    \item That time flows independently of the system.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Why This Framework Does Not Apply to WILL Geometry}

WILL Geometry begins from a fundamentally different premise.

\begin{itemize}
    \item There is no "space" of possible paths.
    \item There is no "freedom to vary."
    \item The system does not evolve through time --- it \textbf{defines time} through its structure.
\end{itemize}

In this model:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Each observable is locked in a network of algebraic relations.
    \item Any change in one parameter \textit{necessitates} coherent changes in the others.
    \item   Self-consistency enforces projectional  \textbf{balance}.
\end{itemize}

There is only one valid configuration at any moment:  
the one where all projectional constraints are satisfied.  
Everything else is not forbidden — it is undefined.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Geometric Principle of Action]
In WILL Geometry, there is no equation of motion.  
There is no Lagrangian.  
There is no variational calculus.  

There is only a closed system of geometric and energetic relationships,  
and the sequence of valid configurations is what we call \textit{dynamics}.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!40!black,title=The only necessary input:]
 \textbf{The observable sequence of transformations in the system's energy geometry is the only necessary input for describing its evolution.
.}\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Time as an Emergent Property}

In this framework, time is not a fundamental entity but a derived concept tied to changes in the system's geometry. Similar to time dilation in special relativity, time intervals here are defined by the evolution of geometric parameters like \(r_{d}}\) and \(\kappa\). This eliminates the need for an external clock.

A natural time scale arises from the geometry as \(t_{d} = \frac{r_{d}}{c}\). For instance, during mass accretion onto a black hole, \(r_{d}\) adjusts as the mass changes, and \(t_{d}\) evolves accordingly. This intrinsic time scale encapsulates the system's dynamics without invoking an independent time variable.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!40!black,title=Note for readers accustomed to classical dynamics]
Unlike traditional formulations of dynamics based on an external time parameter \(t\), the WILL Geometry framework describes evolution as an intrinsic transformation of the system's geometric structure. Time is not a fundamental variable but an emergent quantity derived from energy redistribution. All physical change is encoded in the interdependence of parameters \(\beta\), \(\kappa\), and \(\rho\), etc without requiring differential equations or initial conditions.\\

This marks a fundamental shift: dynamics here is not a process unfolding "in time," but a change in relational energy geometry itself. The model does not track evolution through an imposed temporal axis — instead, it reveals that what we perceive as temporal progression is a manifestation of continuous geometric reconfiguration. \textbf{Thus, prediction becomes a question of geometric continuity, not temporal evolution.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{From Structure to Motion}

In the next section, we present the core structural closure of the system ---  
a set of algebraic invariants that together form the backbone of all observed dynamics.  
These relations are not definitions.  
They are the \textbf{complete geometry of change}, seen from within.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Dynamics in WILL Geometry]
Dynamics in WILL Geometry is not described by differential equations
but by the ordered succession of globally balanced, algebraically determined configurations.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Algebraic Closure and Structural Causality}

In WILL Geometry, physical dynamics emerges from a set of algebraically closed invariants.  
Each parameter participates in a self-consistent configuration of relational constraints.  
There are no functions, no dependent variables, and no variation over time --- only balanced configurations.

The following set of relations expresses the minimal algebraic closure of the WILL structure:

\[
\begin{cases}
\kappa^2 = 2 \beta^2 \\
R_s = \dfrac{2G m_0}{c^2} \\
r_{d} \cdot \kappa^2 = R_s \\
\rho = \dfrac{\kappa^2 c^2}{8\pi Gr_{d}^2} \\
H = \dfrac{c}{r_{d}} \\
\Lambda = \dfrac{\kappa^2}{r_{d}^2} \\
m_0 = 4\pi r_{d}^3 \cdot \rho
\end{cases}
\]

These are not definitions.  
They are mutual constraints --- an algebraic simultaneity.  
Changing any one parameter necessitates a coordinated shift in all others to maintain validity.

\subsection*{Causal Closure without Circularity}

The structure of WILL Geometry is causally closed but not circular.  
Each parameter is either independently observable or computable from a minimal input pair  
consisting of one dynamic projection (such as $\kappa$ or $\beta$) and one scale quantity (such as $r$, $M$, or $\rho$).

The system avoids circularity by ensuring that no parameter both defines and is defined by the same input.  
Instead, values propagate through directed dependencies rooted in physically measurable quantities.  
Multiple valid entry points exist, but all reduce to consistent, non-redundant relationships  
governed by the fundamental geometric field equation.

The result is a structure where \textbf{causality is internal}, \textbf{coherence is enforced},  
and \textbf{dynamics is simply the shifting of balanced configurations} ---  
not the unfolding of arbitrary functions over time.


\subsection{Numerical Example: Accretion onto a Black Hole}

Consider a black hole accreting mass from a surrounding disk to illustrate the model's intrinsic dynamics. Let the initial mass be $m_0 = 10 , M_\odot$, with a Schwarzschild radius $R_s = \frac{2 G m_0}{c^2} \approx 2.95 \times 10^4 , \text{m}$. Suppose $\kappa = 0.1$, so $r_{d} = \frac{R_s}{\kappa^2} = \frac{2.95 \times 10^4}{0.01} = 2.95 \times 10^6 , \text{m}$, and the associated time scale is $t_{d} = \frac{r_{d}}{c} \approx 9.83 \times 10^{-3} , \text{s}$.

As the black hole accretes mass, increasing to $m_1 = 10.1 , M_\odot$, the Schwarzschild radius becomes $R_s \approx 2.98 \times 10^4 , \text{m}$. Assuming $\kappa$ remains constant for simplicity, $r_{d} = \frac{2.98 \times 10^4}{0.01} = 2.98 \times 10^6 , \text{m}$, and $t_{d} \approx 9.93 \times 10^{-3} , \text{s}$. This increase in $t_{d}$ reflects the system's evolution, driven solely by the changing geometry.
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!40!black,title=No differential equations are required:]
 \textbf{Dynamics unfolds as a consequence of relational energy evolution.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{General Principle of Dynamics}

The overarching principle in WILL Geometry is that any physical change—be it mass accretion, gravitational collapse, or expansion—manifests as a transformation in the geometric structure. The parameters \(\beta\), \(\kappa\), and \(r_{d}\) adjust self-consistently, ensuring that the system's evolution is fully described within the model. This approach eliminates the need for differential equations of motion or external initial conditions, as the geometry at any given "moment" is determined by the current energy configuration.

Thus, the temporal sequence we observe is simply the ordered unfolding of geometric transitions:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Time} \equiv \text{Change in } (\kappa, \beta, \rho, r_{d}...)

\]

 This leads to a unified, self-consistent model where **geometry generates both evolution and observability**. There is no external timeline — only evolving curvature.
 
\subsection{Conclusion}

In conclusion, dynamics in WILL Geometry emerges naturally from the redistribution of energy within the system's geometric framework. Time arises as a consequence of these geometric changes, providing a unified description of spacetime and energy evolution. This intrinsic approach simplifies the treatment of dynamical processes and offers a novel perspective on the nature of physical systems.

Physics is not the evolution of a system through time,\\
but the geometric transformation of the energy landscape,\\

\section{Correspondence with General Relativity}

\subsection{Equivalence with Schwarzschild Solution}
\begin{theorem}[Equivalence with Schwarzschild Solution]
The WILL Geometry formalism reproduces the Schwarzschild metric in the appropriate limit.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The Schwarzschild metric in General Relativity is given by:
\begin{align}
ds^2 = \left(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)c^2dt^2 - \left(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)^{-1}dr^2 - r^2d\Omega^2
\end{align}
where $d\Omega^2 = d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta d\phi^2$ is the metric on the unit sphere.

In WILL Geometry, the key parameters are:
\begin{align}
\kappa^2 &= \frac{R_s}{r} = \frac{2GM}{rc^2} \\
T_c &= \sqrt{1-\kappa^2} = \sqrt{1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}} \\
L_d &= \frac{1}{T_c} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}}}
\end{align}

The time component of the Schwarzschild metric can be written as:
\begin{align}
g_{tt} = \left(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right) = 1-\kappa^2 = T_c^2
\end{align}

And the radial component can be written as:
\begin{align}
g_{rr} = -\left(1-\frac{2GM}{rc^2}\right)^{-1} = -\frac{1}{1-\kappa^2} = -\frac{1}{T_c^2} = -L_d^2
\end{align}

Therefore, in WILL Geometry terms, the Schwarzschild metric takes the form:
\begin{align}
ds^2 = T_c^2 c^2dt^2 - L_d^2 dr^2 - r^2d\Omega^2
\end{align}

This demonstrates that the WILL Geometry parameters exactly reproduce the Schwarzschild metric.
\end{proof}
\subsection{Equivalence with Einstein Field Equations}
\begin{theorem}[Equivalence with Einstein Field Equations]
The geometric field equation of WILL Geometry is equivalent to Einstein's field equations.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Einstein's field equations in General Relativity are:
\begin{align}
G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}T_{\mu\nu}
\end{align}
where $G_{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor and $T_{\mu\nu}$ is the energy-momentum tensor.

For a spherically symmetric system with perfect fluid, the $tt$-component of Einstein's equations reduces to:
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}\left(r\left(1-\frac{1}{g_{rr}}\right)\right) = \frac{8\pi G}{c^2}\rho(r)
\end{align}

In Energy Geometry terms:
\begin{align}
g_{rr} &= -L_d^2 = -\frac{1}{T_c^2} \\
1-\frac{1}{g_{rr}} &= 1-(-T_c^2) = 1+T_c^2 = 1+(1-\kappa^2) = 2-\kappa^2
\end{align}

Substituting:
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}(r(2-\kappa^2)) &= \frac{8\pi G}{c^2}\rho(r) \\
\frac{1}{r^2}\left(\frac{d}{dr}(2r) - \frac{d}{dr}(r\kappa^2)\right) &= \frac{8\pi G}{c^2}\rho(r) \\
\frac{1}{r^2}\left(2 - \frac{d}{dr}(r\kappa^2)\right) &= \frac{8\pi G}{c^2}\rho(r)
\end{align}

For a static distribution where $\kappa$ is only a function of $r$:
\begin{align}
-\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}(r\kappa^2) &= \frac{8\pi G}{c^2}\rho(r) - \frac{2}{r^2} \\
\end{align}

The term $\frac{2}{r^2}$ corresponds to the vacuum solution. For matter content:
\begin{align}
-\frac{d}{dr}(r\kappa^2) &= \frac{8\pi G}{c^2}r^2\rho(r) - 2 \\
\end{align}

Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to $r$ and simplifying:
\begin{align}
-\frac{d^2}{dr^2}(r\kappa^2) &= \frac{8\pi G}{c^2}\frac{d}{dr}(r^2\rho(r))
\end{align}

This is directly related to our geometric field equation:
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dr}(\kappa^2 r) = \frac{8\pi G}{c^2}r^2\rho(r)
\end{align}

Therefore, the WILL Geometry field equation is equivalent to Einstein's field equations.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Asymmetric Generality}
The correspondence between these frameworks is fundamentally asymmetric. General Relativity, with its reliance on a pre-supposed metric tensor and the formalism of differential geometry, can be viewed as a specific, parameter-heavy instance of the WILL framework's principles. One can derive GR by adding these additional structures to WILL's minimalist foundation. Therefore, the choice between them is not one of preference, but of logical generality and parsimony, with WILL being presented as the more fundamental underlying structure.

\section{Relational Foundation Theorem: WILL vs. GR}

\begin{definition}[GR Core Axioms]
General Relativity (GR) is assumed to rest on the following axioms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(A1)] The spacetime arena is a smooth Lorentzian manifold with metric $g_{\mu\nu}$.
    \item[(A2)] Diffeomorphism invariance (general covariance): the form of physical laws is independent of coordinates.
    \item[(A3)] Local Lorentz invariance / Einstein equivalence principle: locally, spacetime is Minkowskian.
    \item[(A4)] Einstein Field Equations (EFE): $G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[WILL Foundational Postulate]
The WILL framework is based on a single axiom:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(W1)] \textbf{Relational Postulate:} All physical magnitudes are defined purely by relations between entities; spacetime is equivalent to energy evolution.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Relationality in GR]
From A2 and A3 it follows that observable quantities in GR are coordinate-independent
and must be expressed relationally. In particular, no absolute magnitudes can serve
as observables.
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}[Bridge: From Relational Postulate to GR Axioms]
If the Relational Postulate (W1) were false, then physical magnitudes
could in principle be defined in absolute, non-relational terms. 
Such absolutes would provide a hidden external reference structure.
But this contradicts the core of GR:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It violates diffeomorphism invariance (A2), since coordinate independence
    presupposes that only relational quantities are observable.
    \item It undermines the equivalence principle (A3), since local Minkowski structure 
    relies on the impossibility of distinguishing absolute magnitudes from relative ones.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, the negation of W1 directly negates A2 and A3. 
This establishes the logical dependency required for the asymmetry theorem below.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}[Asymmetric Falsifiability of GR and WILL]
\label{thm:asymmetry}
Let $\mathsf{GR}$ denote the theory defined by axioms (A1)--(A4),
and let $\mathsf{WILL}$ denote the theory defined by postulate (W1).
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If (W1) is empirically falsified, then (A2)--(A3) are also falsified. 
    Hence, $\mathsf{GR}$ is necessarily falsified.
    \item If any of (A1)--(A3) are empirically falsified, $\mathsf{GR}$ collapses,
    but (W1) may still remain valid as a stand-alone principle.
\end{enumerate}
Therefore, there exist possible empirical scenarios in which GR fails
while WILL survives, but there exist no scenarios in which WILL fails
while GR survives.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
WILL is axiomatically more fundamental than GR: 
its sole postulate (W1) is logically included within the core axioms of GR, 
while GR requires additional ontological structures 
(metric geometry, equivalence principle, Einstein equations) that are 
not necessary for the consistency of WILL.

\textbf{Conclusion (Axiomatic Inclusion and Asymmetric Falsifiability).} \\
\emph{WILL} rests on the single relational postulate (W1). Core GR assumes additional structures (A1--A4). Hence:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If \textbf{W1} is empirically falsified, GR's core (A2--A3) is undermined; thus GR is falsified.
  \item If any of \textbf{A1--A3} is falsified, GR collapses, while \textbf{W1} (and thus WILL) may still hold.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, there are scenarios where GR fails and WILL survives, but none where WILL fails while GR survives.

\section{Empirical Validation}


\subsection{Geometric Prediction of Photon Sphere and ISCO}

\begin{theorem}[Critical Radii Emergence]
In the WILL Geometry framework, the critical orbital radii of the photon sphere and innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) emerge naturally from the geometric equilibrium where $\theta_S = \theta_G$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
A notable geometric equilibrium occurs at the critical angle 
\begin{equation}
    \theta_S = \theta_G= 54.7356103172^{\circ} \text{ (balance point for photon sphere and ISCO)}
\end{equation}
or approximately $\theta_S = \theta_G \approx 0.9553\,\text{radians}$.

\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[thick] (0,0) circle(1);
\draw[-, thick] (0,0.816) -- (0.577,0.816) node[midway, above] {$\sqrt{1 - \kappa^2}$};
\draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (0.577,0.816) node[below, right] {$E$};
\draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (0,0.816) node[midway, left] {$\kappa$};
\draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (0.577,0) node[midway, below] {$\beta$};;
\draw[->, thick] (0.577,0) -- (0.577,0.816) node[midway, right] {$\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}$};
\end{tikzpicture}

This equilibrium yields the fundamental relation:
\begin{equation}
\kappa^2 + \beta^2 = 1,
\end{equation}
These critical radii emerge spontaneously from the geometry, suggesting inherent spacetime structure without additional assumptions.

\subsubsection{Mathematical Derivation of Critical Points}

Key critical points include:
When:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\kappa = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}} \approx 0.816\) and \(\beta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \approx 0.577\), corresponding to:
    \[
    r = \frac{R_s}{\kappa^2} =\frac{3}{2}R_s = 1.5R_s \quad \text{(radius of the photon sphere)}.
    \]
    When:
    \item      \( \kappa=\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\approx 0.577, \quad \text{and} \quad  \beta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \approx 0.408\), leading to orbital distance:
    \[
    r = \frac{R_s}{2\beta^2} = \frac{R_s}{2 \cdot \frac{1}{6}} = 3R_s \quad \text{(radius of the innermost stable circular orbit, ISCO)}.
    \]
\end{itemize}

At the critical point where \(\beta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\) and \(\kappa = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\), the following relationships hold:
\begin{align}
\theta_S &= \theta_G \\
\beta &= T_c \\
\kappa &= L_c \\
\cos(\theta_{G}-\theta_{S}) &= 0 \\
 Q &=\sqrt{\kappa^2 + \beta^2}=1 \\
Q_t &= \sqrt{1-Q^2} =\sqrt{1-3\beta^2} = 0 \quad \text{(Instability threshold)}
\end{align}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!40!black,title=Interpretive Note]
While the radii \(1.5R_s\) (photon sphere) and \(3R_s\) (ISCO) are known from classical General Relativity, their spontaneous emergence from angle equality \(\theta_S = \theta_G\) in our geometric framework is not imposed but arises from internal energy projection symmetries. This correspondence reinforces the internal consistency and explanatory power of WILL Geometry.

\textit{Geometry defines causality before mass, and curvature before gravity.}
\]

\end{proof}

\subsection{Energy Symmetry Validation: GPS Satellite and Earth}

\begin{theorem}[Real-World Energy Symmetry]
The Energy Symmetry Law holds precisely for the Earth-GPS satellite system.
 WILL-invariant ($W_{\text{ill}} = 1$) holds exactly for the Earth–GPS satellite system.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We verify the Energy Symmetry Law on real orbital data for a GPS satellite and an observer on the Earth's surface, using the following parameters:

\textbf{ Input Data}
\begin{itemize}
\item Gravitational constant: $G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11}$ m$^3$/kg/s$^2$
\item Speed of light: $c = 2.99792458 \times 10^8$ m/s
\item Mass of Earth: $M_{Earth} = 5.972 \times 10^{24}$ kg
\item Radius of Earth: $R_{Earth} = 6.370 \times 10^6$ m
\item Radius of GPS orbit: $r_{GPS} = 2.6571 \times 10^7$ m
\item Seconds in 24 hours $D_{aySeconds} =86400 \quad  \text{s}$
\item Nanoseconds in 1 second $N_{ano}=10^6  \quad \mu\text{ s}$
\end{itemize}

The orbital velocity of the GPS satellite is:
\begin{align}
v_{GPS} &= \sqrt{\frac{GM_{Earth}}{r_{GPS}}} 
= \sqrt{\frac{6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \times 5.972 \times 10^{24}}{2.6571 \times 10^7}} 
= 3873.10090455 \text{ m/s}
\end{align}

Converting to dimensionless parameters:
\begin{align}
\beta_{GPS} &= \frac{v_{GPS}}{c} = \frac{3873.10090455}{2.99792458 \times 10^8} =0.0000129192739884 \\
\kappa_{GPS} &= \sqrt{\frac{2GM_{Earth}}{c^2 r_{GPS}}} =0.0000182706124904 \\
\frac{\kappa_{GPS}^{2}}{\beta_{GPS}^{2}} &=\frac{3.3381528077\times10^{-10}}{1.6690764039\times10^{-10}}=2 \\
Q_{GPS} &=\sqrt{\beta_{GPS}^{2}\ +\kappa_{GPS}^{2}}=0.0000223768389448 \\
Q_{tGPS} &=\sqrt{1-Q_{GPS}^{2}}=\sqrt{1-3\beta_{GPS}^{2}}=0.99999999975
\end{align}
For the Earth's surface:
\begin{align}
\kappa_{Earth} &= \sqrt{\frac{2GM_{Earth}}{c^2 R_{Earth}}} = 0.000037312405944\\
\beta_{Earth} &= 0 \text{ (at rest)} \\
Q_{Earth} &=\sqrt{\beta_{Earth}^{2}\ +\kappa_{Earth}^{2}}=0.000037312405944 \\
Q_{tEarth} &=\sqrt{1-Q_{Earth}^{2}}=0.999999999304
\end{align}
The daily relativistic time offset between GPS and Earth is:
\[
\Delta Q_{t,{\rm GPS} \rightarrow {\rm Earth}} = (Q_{t,{\rm GPS}} - Q_{t,{\rm Earth}}) \cdot 86400 \cdot 10^6 = 38.52~\mu\text{s/day}
\]
This \textbf{matches the empirical time correction required} for GPS synchronization  to high precision.

\subsubsection{WILL invariant validation:}

$W_{ILLGPS}$ parameters of mass energy time and space:
\begin{align*}

M_{GPS} &= T_{dGPS} \beta_{GPS}^2 c^2 \frac{r_{GPS}}{G} \\

E_{GPS} &= L_{dGPS} \frac{\kappa_{GPS}^2 c^4 r_{GPS}}{2G} \\

T_{GPS} &= T_{cGPS} \left(\frac{2GM_{Earth}}{\kappa_{GPS}^2 c^3}\right)^2 \\

L_{GPS} &= L_{cGPS} \left(\frac{GM_{Earth}}{\beta_{GPS}^2 c^2}\right)^2

\end{align*}
Where:
\begin{align*}

L_{cGPS} &= \sqrt{1-\beta_{GPS}^2} \\

T_{dGPS} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta_{GPS}^2}} \\

L_{dGPS} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\kappa_{GPS}^2}} \\

T_{cGPS} &= \sqrt{1-\kappa_{GPS}^2}

\end{align*}
The explicit $W_{ILL}=ET^2 / ML^2=1$ - invariant for the GPS–Earth system, including both GR and SR effects, is:  $$W_{ILLGPS}=\frac{E_{GPS} \cdot T_{GPS}}{M_{GPS} \cdot L_{GPS}} = \frac{
   L_{dGPS}\frac{\kappa_{\rm GPS}^{2} c^{4} r_{\rm GPS}}{2G}
    \cdot T_{cGPS} \left(\frac{2 G M_{\rm Earth}}{\kappa_{\rm GPS}^{2} c^{3}}\right)^{2}
}{
    T_{dGPS}\frac{\beta_{\rm GPS}^{2} c^{2} r_{\rm GPS}}{G}
    \cdot L_{cGPS} \left(\frac{G M_{\rm Earth}}{\beta_{\rm GPS}^{2} c^{2}}\right)^{2}
} = 1$$

All physical quantities cancel identically, leaving $L_{dGPS} T_{cGPS} = T_{dGPS} L_{cGPS}$, which is satisfied by geometric construction.

\subsubsection{Energy Symmetry Law validation:}

The energy difference from Earth observer to GPS satellite is:
\begin{align}
\Delta E_{Earth \rightarrow GPS} &= \frac{1}{2}((\kappa^2_{Earth} - \kappa^2_{GPS}) + \beta^2_{GPS})
= 6.1265399845\times10^{-10}
\end{align}

The energy difference from GPS satellite to Earth is:
\begin{align}
\Delta E_{GPS \rightarrow Earth} &= \frac{1}{2}( (\kappa^2_{GPS} - \kappa^2_{Earth}) - \beta^2_{GPS}) = -6.1265399845\times10^{-10}
\end{align}
Therefore:
\begin{align}
\Delta E_{GPS \rightarrow Earth}+\Delta E_{Earth \rightarrow GPS}  = -6.1265399845\times10^{-10} + 6.1265399845\times10^{-10} = 0
\end{align}

This \textbf{confirms the Energy Symmetry Law} to machine precision using real-world orbital and physical data.

And lets also compare the results with real total energy. We will take aproximate mass of GPS satellite:

\[
m_{sat}=600 \quad kg
\]

Classical potential energy   $E_{pGPS}=(-\frac{GM_{Earth}m_{sat}}{r_{GPS}})-(-\frac{GM_{Earth}m_{sat}}{R_{Earth}})$

Classical kinetic energy     $E_{kGPS}=\frac{1}{2}m_{sat}\ v_{GPS}^{2}$

Classical total energy   $E_{tot}=E_{pGPS}+E_{kGPS} = 3.3043450143\times10^{10}  \quad    kg   (m^2
/ s^2)$

\textbf{Conformation of nontriviality of Energy Symmetry Law.} 
\[
\frac{\frac{E_{tot}}{m_{sat}c^{2}}}{\Delta E_{Earth \rightarrow GPS} } = 1
\]

Remarkably, satellite mass $m_{sat}$ does not appear anywhere in the computation of the geometric energy $\Delta E_{Earth \rightarrow GPS}$. Yet, when the total physical energy $E_{tot}$ (the sum of kinetic and potential energies, which does depend on $m_{sat}$ is normalized by the satellite’s rest energy $E_{0GPS} = m_{sat} c^2$ the ratio exactly matches the unitless geometric value as shown above. This confirms that $\Delta E_{Earth \rightarrow GPS}$ precisely encodes the relationship between the system’s real energy and the satellite’s own rest energy, entirely independent of its absolute mass.
In other words, the geometric projection captures the physical “share” of energy—purely as a relational quantity—regardless of the object's individual mass.

\textbf{Physical Logic:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All gravitational and velocity (SR+GR) effects are simple projections, not metric-dependent.
    \item No tensors, no differentials, no explicit metric.
    \item The universe’s “time flow” at each location is just a geometric combination of energy projections.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\emph{“Time does not drive change — instead, change defines time.”}
\end{center}

\end{proof}

\subsection{Relativistic Precession Validation: Mercury and the Sun}

\begin{theorem}[Relativistic Precession Calculation via WILL Geometry]
The relativistic precession of Mercury's orbit matches the classical GR result with high precision, using WILL Geometry projection parameters.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We verify the precession of Mercury's orbit using WILL Geometry and compare it to the GR prediction.

\textbf{Input physical parameters:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Gravitational constant: $G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11}$ m$^3$/kg/s$^2$
\item Speed of light: $c = 2.99792458 \times 10^8$ m/s
\item Mass of the Sun: $M_{\text{Sun}} = 1.98847 \times 10^{30}$ kg
\item Schwarzschild radius of the Sun: $R_{Ssun} = 2.953$ km = $2953$ m
\item Semi-major axis of Mercury: $a_{Merc} = 5.79 \times 10^{10}$ m
\item Eccentricity of Mercury's orbit: $e_{Merc} = 0.2056$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Dimensionless projection parameters for Mercury:}
\begin{align}
\kappa_{Merc} &= \sqrt{\frac{R_{Ssun}}{a_{Merc}}} = \sqrt{\frac{2953}{5.79 \times 10^{10}}} = 0.000225878693163 \\
\beta_{Merc} &= \sqrt{\frac{R_{Ssun}}{2 a_{Merc}}} = \sqrt{\frac{2953}{2 \times 5.79 \times 10^{10}}} = 0.000159720355661
\end{align}

\textbf{Combined energy projection parameter:}
\[
Q_{Merc}=\sqrt{\kappa_{Merc}^{2}+\beta_{Merc}^{2}}=0.000276643771008
\]
\begin{align}
Q_{Merc}^{2} &= 3 \beta_{Merc}^{2} = 3 \times (0.000159720355661)^2 = 7.6531776038 \times 10^{-8}
\end{align}

\textbf{Correction factor for the elliptic orbit divided by 1 orbital period:}
\begin{align}
\frac{1 - e_{Merc}^{2}}{2\pi} &= \frac{1 - (0.2056)^2}{2 \times 3.14159265359} = \frac{0.9577}{6.28318530718} = 0.152427247197
\end{align}

\textbf{Final WILL Geometry precession result:}
\begin{align}
M_{PWILL} &= \frac{3 \beta_{Merc}^{2}}{\frac{1 - e_{Merc}^{2}}{2\pi}} = \frac{2\pi Q_{Merc}^{2}}{\left(1-e_{Merc}^{2}\right)}=\frac{7.6531776038 \times 10^{-8}}{0.152427247197} = 5.0208724126 \times 10^{-7}
\end{align}

\textbf{Classical GR prediction for precession:}
\begin{align}
M_{PGR} &= \frac{3\pi R_{Ssun}}{a_{Merc} (1 - e_{Merc}^{2})} = \frac{3 \times 3.14159265359 \times 2953}{5.79 \times 10^{10} \times 0.9577} = 5.0208724126 \times 10^{-7}
\end{align}

\textbf{Relative difference:}
\begin{align}
\frac{M_{PGR} - M_{PWILL}}{M_{PGR}} \times 100 &= \frac{5.0208724126 \times 10^{-7} - 5.0208724126 \times 10^{-7}}{5.0208724126 \times 10^{-7}} \times 100 \\
&= 2.1918652104 \times 10^{-10} \%
\end{align}

This negligible difference is consistent with the numerical precision limits of floating-point arithmetic, confirming that Will Geometry reproduces the observed relativistic precession of Mercury to within machine accuracy.

\subsection{Orbital Decay: Binary Pulsar}

\begin{theorem}[Eccentricity factor for quadrupolar emission]\label{thm:Fe}
For a bound Keplerian orbit with eccentricity $e$, the normalized orbit-average
of $|\partial_t^{\,3} S|^2$ for the spin-2 STF surrogate $S(f)=r(f)^2 e^{i2f}$ equals
\[
F(e)=\frac{\big\langle\,|\partial_t^{\,3} S|^2\big\rangle}
{\big\langle\,|\partial_t^{\,3} S|^2\big\rangle_{e=0}}
=\frac{1+\frac{73}{24}e^2+\frac{37}{96}e^4}{(1-e^2)^{7/2}}\,,
\qquad F(0)=1.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\textbf{Setup and notation.}
Let $p=a(1-e^2)$, $r(f)=p/(1+e\cos f)$ and define the affine parameter $u$ by $du=dt/r^2$,
so that $df/du=h$ with constant $h=r^2\dot f$ (specific angular momentum).
For any scalar $X(f)$ set $D\equiv d/df$ and
\[
L X \equiv \partial_t X=\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{dX}{du}= h\,\sigma(f)\,D X,\qquad
\sigma(f)\equiv r^{-2}=\frac{(1+e\cos f)^2}{p^2}.
\]
The radiative spin-2 surrogate is $S(f)=r(f)^2 e^{i2f}$.

\begin{lemma}[Variable-coefficient cubic identity]\label{lem:cubic}
For $\sigma=\sigma(f)$ and $D=d/df$,
\[
(\sigma D)^{3} S
= \sigma^{3} D^{3} S
+ 3\sigma^{2} (D\sigma)\, D^{2} S
+ \big(\sigma(D\sigma)^{2} + \sigma^{2} D^{2}\sigma\big)\, D S.
\]
Hence $L^3S=h^{3}(\sigma D)^3 S$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Explicit derivatives]\label{lem:derivs}
With $x\equiv e\cos f$ and $r=p/(1+x)$, one has
\[
Dr=\frac{pe\sin f}{(1+x)^2},\qquad
D\sigma=\frac{2e\sin f}{p^2}(1+x),\qquad
D^{2}\sigma=\frac{2}{p^2}\big(e\cos f + e^2 -2e^2\sin^2 f\big).
\]
Furthermore,
\[
DS=e^{i2f}\big(2r\,Dr+i2\,r^2\big),\quad
D^{2}S=e^{i2f}\big(2(Dr)^2+2r\,D^{2}r+ i4r\,Dr -4r^2\big),
\]
\[
D^{3}S=e^{i2f}\Big(6Dr\,D^{2}r+2r\,D^{3}r + i2\big(2(Dr)^2+2r\,D^{2}r\big)
 - i8 r\,Dr - i8 r^2\Big),
\]
with $D^{k}r$ obtained by differentiating $r=p(1+x)^{-1}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Orbit averages]\label{lem:avg}
For integers $m,n\ge0$ and $k\ge2$,
\[
\Big\langle \frac{\cos^{m}\!f\,\sin^{n}\!f}{(1+e\cos f)^{k}}\Big\rangle
=\frac{1}{2\pi}\!\int_{0}^{2\pi}\!\frac{\cos^{m}\!f\,\sin^{n}\!f}{(1+e\cos f)^{k}}\,df
=\sum_{j} c_{j}(m,n,k)\,\frac{e^{2j}}{(1-e^{2})^{\alpha_{j}}},
\]
where $c_j$ are rational numbers and $\alpha_j\in\{\tfrac12,\tfrac32,\tfrac52,\dots\}$.
In particular, the needed set with $k\in\{2,\dots,8\}$ closes under the algebra of
Lemma~\ref{lem:cubic}.
\end{lemma}

\textbf{Conclusion.}
Insert Lemma~\ref{lem:derivs} into Lemma~\ref{lem:cubic} to express $(\sigma D)^3S$
as a linear combination of $\{\cos^{m}\!f\,\sin^{n}\!f\}/(1+e\cos f)^{k}$.
Average over one cycle using Lemma~\ref{lem:avg}. The overall factor $h^{3}$ cancels
in the normalization by the $e=0$ case, leaving a rational function of $e$ times
$(1-e^{2})^{-7/2}$. A straightforward (finite) simplification yields the stated closed form
for $F(e)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Orbital period decay of a binary pulsar]\label{thm:Pdot}
For component masses $m_1,m_2$ (total $M=m_1+m_2$), orbital period $P_b$ and eccentricity $e$,
the decay rate of $P_b$ due to quadrupolar radiation is
\[
\dot P_b
= -\frac{192\pi G^{5/3}}{5c^5}\,
\frac{m_1 m_2}{(m_1+m_2)^{1/3}}\,
\Big(\frac{2\pi}{P_b}\Big)^{5/3}\,F(e),
\]
where $F(e)$ is given by Theorem~\ref{thm:Fe}.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The orbit-averaged quadrupole luminosity scales as
$\langle P_{\rm GW}\rangle \propto \mu^{2} M^{4/3} n^{10/3} F(e)$ with $\mu=m_1m_2/M$ and
$n=2\pi/P_b$. Using $n^{2}a^{3}=GM$ and the Newtonian binding energy $E=-GM\mu/(2a)$,
energy balance $\dot E=-\langle P_{\rm GW}\rangle$ yields $\dot a$, hence
$\dot P_b=(dP_b/da)\,\dot a$. Eliminating $a$ and collecting constants gives the stated formula,
with all eccentricity dependence entering solely through $F(e)$.
No asymptotic background structures (ADM/Bondi) are invoked.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection*{Numerical benchmarks and observational comparison}
We now evaluate Eq.~(\ref{thm:Pdot}) for two archetypal systems.
Constants: $G=6.67430\times10^{-11}\,$SI, $c=2.99792458\times10^{8}\,$m/s,

\section{Conclusion}

 WILL Geometry fully reproduces the predictive content and central equations of both Special and General Relativity, while simultaneously addressing their foundational inconsistencies: 
 \begin{itemize}
     \item (1) the lack of an operational definition of local gravitational energy density in GR, 
     \item (2) the artificial separation of kinetic and gravitational energy in SR and GR, and 
     \item (3) the emergence of singularities as pathological artifacts of coordinate-based models. By treating energy evolution as the true basis of geometry, WILL unifies and extends these frameworks into a fully relational and operationally grounded description of spacetime and energy.
 \end{itemize}

By focusing on the projectional nature of energy, we have shown that spacetime itself is merely the manifestation of energy's evolution.

From a single postulate—that spacetime is equivalent to energy evolution—we derived all the mathematical apparatus needed to describe gravitational and relativistic phenomena. This unification, showing that energy, time, space, and mass are merely different projections of the same underlying structure.
\[
\boxed{\text{Special and General Relativity emerge from the same geometric principles.}}
\]
This approach offers distinct advantages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Conceptual clarity — understanding physics through pure geometry
\item Computational efficiency — reducing complexity by up to 95\%
\item Epistemological hygiene — deriving results from minimal assumptions
\item Philosophical depth — redefining our understanding of time, mass, and causality
\end{itemize}

WILL Geometry is not merely a reformulation of existing theories, but a paradigm shift that inverts our fundamental understanding: 
\[
\boxed{\text{Energy does not exist within spacetime—spacetime emerges from the evolution of energy.}}

\section{Epilogue: On the Motivation of This Work}

This work is not the product of formal academic research, institutional funding, or collaboration with established scientific communities. It is the result of personal inquiry, curiosity, and an ongoing attempt to understand the fundamental nature of space, time, and energy from the most elementary and geometric principles.

The motivation behind this framework is rooted in a deep philosophical belief that the structure of the Universe must, at its core, can be described without arbitrary parameters, assumptions, or external mathematical constructs. The ideal theory should not rely on pre-existing formalism but should emerge naturally from the geometry of the Universe itself.

It is important to clarify that I do not consider myself an academic authority, nor do I claim to have discovered any new physical law. I am a self-taught enthusiast, driven not by the desire for recognition but by a personal need to resolve fundamental questions about reality in the simplest possible terms.

Throughout this research, I have maintained a rigorous internal skepticism, questioning every step and assumption. The fact that I have arrived at results equivalent to the standard formulations of Special and General Relativity using only geometric first principles may appear unlikely, even to myself. I fully acknowledge the statistical improbability of such an achievement by an individual without formal academic training.

However, this work is not an attempt to replace or dispute existing physics but rather to reinterpret it from a geometric and philosophical standpoint. Whether this approach holds broader value is irrelevant to its primary purpose — to provide a coherent and intuitive framework that satisfies my own intellectual and philosophical curiosity.

Above all, this document serves as a personal record and reflection of a journey toward understanding, reminding me of the reasons why I chose to embark on this path.


P.S. \textit{This work remains an ongoing exploration, and further developments may reveal deeper connections between geometry, energy, and the fabric of reality.

                   \section{Glossary of Key Terms}

\begin{description}

\item[$\beta$ (Beta):] The kinetic projection, representing the ratio of an object's velocity to the universal speed of evolution \((v/c)\). It quantifies how much of the "speed of change" is perceived as motion through space relative to observer. Not an intrinsic property of an object but rather a measure of the differences between states, perceived from the perspective of an observer.

\item[$c$ (Universal Speed of Evolution):] The fundamental, invariant tempo of change in the universe. It is not merely the speed of light but the constant rate at which all energetic interactions and transformations occur.

\item[Conservation Law:] The principle stating that the total energy of the universe must remain constant. In WILL Geometry, this is a direct logical consequence of the universe being a closed and self-sufficient system.

\item[Critical Density \((\rho_{\max})\):] A local, finite limit on how much energy can be packed into a given radius, dependent on central mass and the distance from it center. It increases closer to a central mass but never becomes infinite, thus preventing the formation of infinite densities (singularities).

\item[Energy–Momentum Triangle:] A geometric visualization in WILL Geometry that depicts the relationship between an object's rest energy, momentum, and total energy as the sides of a right triangle, illustrating their constant interconnectedness.

\item[Energy–Symmetry Law:] The principle in WILL Geometry stating that energy differences observed between any two frames of reference will always perfectly balance out, ensuring no "extra" energy is created or lost, and thus enforcing causality and naturally explains why any spacial motion limited by speed of light.

\item[Epistemological Hygiene:] A guiding principle that demands the rejection of all assumptions not strictly necessary, building the theory solely on logical sequence from a minimalist foundation.

\item[Event Horizon:] The boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape. In WILL Geometry, \(\kappa = 1\) at this point, indicating that the escape venosity here is equal to speed of light.

\item[Geometric Structures (Circle \(S^1\) and Sphere \(S^2\)):] The fundamental, non spacial, maximally symmetric and closed geometric "canvases" on which physical reality is projected in WILL Geometry. The circle describes 1D unidirectional motion (Special Relativity), and the sphere describes 2D omnidirectional gravity (General Relativity).

\item[$\kappa$ (Kappa):] The potential projection. It measures how deeply an object is situated within a gravitational field, relative to an observer, and indicates proximity to an event horizon. Not an intrinsic property of an object but rather a measure of the differences between states, perceived from the perspective of an observer.

\item[Photon Sphere:] A specific region around a massive object where light can orbit in a perfect, unstable circular path. In WILL Geometry, this corresponds to a braking point where the sum of kinetic and potential projections are reaching unity \((Q^2=\kappa^{2} + \beta^{2} = 1)\).

\item[Relational View of Energy:] The concept in WILL Geometry that energy is not an intrinsic property of an object but rather a measure of the differences between states, perceived from the perspective of an observer.

\item[Singularity:] A point of infinite density predicted by traditional General Relativity (e.g., at the center of a black hole). WILL Geometry's framework inherently prevents singularities, replacing them with finite, maximum allowed densities.

\item[\( \text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION} \):] The central, unifying postulate of WILL Geometry, asserting that the fabric of spacetime is identical to the full structure of all possible transitions and interconnections between energetic states.

\item[Symmetry:] A core principle in WILL Geometry derived from the postulate, stating that in a closed system without external reference points, the geometry of the universe must be maximally symmetric. No preferred directions.

\item[Time/Length Dilation/Contraction:] The phenomenon where time passes more slowly for an observer or object. In WILL Geometry, it is explained as a consequence of how the universal "speed of evolution" budget is allocated between motion (kinetic time dilation) and gravitational potential (gravitational time dilation).

\item[WILL Invariant \((W_{\text{ill}})\):] A dimensionless constant \((=1)\) that mathematically connects energy, mass, time, and length within the WILL Geometry framework, demonstrating the self-consistency of the system.

\begin{align}
\text{exactly matching the global algebraic form used in Table 1.}
