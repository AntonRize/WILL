\title{WILL Part III: Geometric Quantization and the Origin of the Fine Structure Constant}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This paper, the third in the WILL series, applies the principles of Relational Geometry to the quantum realm. From the foundational principle \textbf{SPACETIME $\equiv$ ENERGY}, we derive the complete structure of the hydrogen atom. By enforcing geometric and topological closure, we demonstrate that quantization is not a separate postulate but an inevitable consequence of a self-consistent relational system. This framework derives the Bohr radius, the quantized energy levels, and reveals the fine structure constant, $\alpha$, to be nothing more than the kinetic projection parameter, $\beta$, of the electron in its ground state. The derivation requires no classical force analogues, probabilistic wavefunctions, or differential equations, establishing atomic structure as a direct manifestation of relational geometry.

\section{The Principle of Geometric Closure in Quantum Systems}

We begin with the foundational principle established in WILL Part I: any stable, self-contained system must be described by a closed and self-consistent relational geometry.

\begin{principle}[Geometric Closure]
\label{pr:closure}
A system in a stable, stationary state must be represented by a geometry that is topologically closed. All relational projections describing the system must return to their initial values after a complete cycle, ensuring the continuity and integrity of the configuration.
\end{principle}

For a bound electron in an atom, this principle has a direct and profound consequence.

\begin{proposition}[Topological Quantization Condition]
The principle of Geometric Closure, when applied to a bound electron, requires its relational wave to form a standing wave around the orbital circumference. This is expressed by the condition:
\[
n \lambda_n = 2\pi r_n, \quad n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots
\]
where $\lambda_n$ is the electron's de Broglie wavelength on the $n$-th orbital of radius $r_n$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
If the wave did not close on itself (i.e., if $n$ were not an integer), destructive interference would prevent the formation of a stable, time-independent configuration. Such a state would be geometrically and energetically inconsistent, and thus is not a permissible solution in WILL Geometry. The integer $n$ is therefore a necessary condition for a stable state's existence.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[The Quantum Number as a Topological Invariant]
The principal quantum number, $n$, is not an externally imposed parameter but is the \textbf{topological winding number} of the energy projection's phase. It counts the number of complete phase rotations required for the geometric configuration to close upon itself.
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}[Geometric Quantization of Angular Momentum]
The topological closure condition, combined with the de Broglie relation $\lambda_n = h/p_n$, directly yields the quantization of angular momentum as a geometric necessity, not a separate physical postulate.
\[
n \frac{h}{p_n} = 2\pi r_n \quad \implies \quad \boxed{p_n r_n = n\hbar}
\]
\end{corollary}

\section{The Universal Scale Principle and Relational Projections}

As established in Part I, the state of any system is fully described by its potential projection ($\kappa$) and kinetic projection ($\beta$). The potential projection is governed by a universal principle connecting the system's geometry to its intrinsic limits.

\begin{principle}[Universal Scale Principle]
\label{pr:scale}
The potential projection $\kappa^2$ is the dimensionless ratio of a system's intrinsic critical scale to its current observational scale.
\[
\kappa^2 = \frac{r_{\text{critical}}}{r_{\text{current}}}
\]
\end{principle}

\begin{remark}[Structural Symmetry of Interactions]
The identical inverse-square form of the gravitational and electromagnetic interactions ($F \propto 1/r^2$) is not a coincidence. It reflects that both are manifestations of the same underlying geometric principle. This compels us to define a critical scale for electromagnetism that is directly analogous to gravity's Schwarzschild radius.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[Electromagnetic Critical Radius]
The electromagnetic critical radius, $R_e$, is the intrinsic scale at which a particle's electrostatic potential energy budget becomes saturated. In the WILL framework, this corresponds to the radius where the potential energy magnitude equals half the particle's rest energy, consistent with the limit $\kappa = 1$ in our energy budget formalism $|U| = \frac{1}{2}E_0 \kappa^2$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Derivation of the Electromagnetic Critical Radius]
For an electron of mass $m_e$ and charge $e$, the electromagnetic critical radius is given by:
\[ R_e = \frac{2e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 m_e c^2} \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We apply the condition from the definition, setting the potential energy magnitude equal to half the rest energy:
\[ |U(R_e)| = \frac{1}{2} E_0 \]
Substituting the physical expressions for the electron:
\[ \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 R_e} = \frac{1}{2} m_e c^2 \]
Solving for $R_e$ directly yields the result. This scale is twice the "classical electron radius" and represents the true point of energetic saturation for the electron's potential field in WILL Geometry.
\end{proof}

\section{Derivation of Atomic Structure from First Principles}

The complete structure of the hydrogen atom is now constrained by a closed system of three fundamental geometric principles, with no further assumptions required.

\begin{lemma}[The Geometric System of Equations]
The stable states of the hydrogen atom are the solutions to the following system:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Topological Closure:} $\beta_n^2 \approx \frac{n^2\hbar^2}{m_e^2 c^2 r_n^2}$
    \item \textbf{Scale Principle:} $\kappa_n^2 = \frac{R_e}{r_n}$
    \item \textbf{Geometric Closure:} $\kappa_n^2 = 2\beta_n^2$
\end{enumerate}
The non-relativistic approximation for $\beta_n$ is used, consistent with the low energy scale of the hydrogen atom.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[Derivation of Quantized Atomic Radii]
The allowed orbital radii $r_n$ are derived solely from the simultaneous solution of the geometric system.
\[ r_n = \frac{4\pi\varepsilon_0 n^2 \hbar^2}{m_e e^2} \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We begin by substituting the expression for $\beta_n^2$ from (1) into the geometric closure condition (3):
\[ \kappa_n^2 = 2 \left( \frac{n^2\hbar^2}{m_e^2 c^2 r_n^2} \right) \]
Next, we equate this with the expression for $\kappa_n^2$ from the scale principle (2):
\[ \frac{R_e}{r_n} = \frac{2n^2\hbar^2}{m_e^2 c^2 r_n^2} \]
We solve for $r_n$. Canceling one factor of $r_n$ from both sides gives:
\[ r_n = \frac{2n^2\hbar^2}{m_e^2 c^2 R_e} \]
Finally, we substitute the derived expression for the critical radius, $R_e = \frac{2e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 m_e c^2}$:
\[ r_n = \frac{2n^2\hbar^2}{m_e^2 c^2} \left( \frac{4\pi\varepsilon_0 m_e c^2}{2e^2} \right) \]
All dependencies on $c$ and one factor of $m_e$ cancel, yielding the final expression for the quantized radii.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[The Bohr Radius as a Geometric Consequence]
The fundamental length scale of the atom, the Bohr radius $a_0$, emerges not from a force balance, but from the intersection of the three geometric principles. For the ground state ($n=1$):
\[
\boxed{ a_0 = r_1 = \frac{4\pi\varepsilon_0 \hbar^2}{m_e e^2} }
\]
\end{corollary}

\section{The Geometric Origin of the Fine Structure Constant}

We now arrive at the central result of this paper. With the atomic length scale $a_0$ derived from pure geometry, we can calculate the electron's relational projections and uncover the identity of a fundamental constant of nature.

\begin{theorem}[The Fine Structure Constant as the Ground-State Kinetic Projection]
The fine structure constant, $\alpha$, is identical to the kinetic projection, $\beta_1$, of the electron in the ground state of the hydrogen atom.
\[
\boxed{\alpha = \beta_1}
\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We use our geometric system to find the value of $\beta_1$. From the geometric closure condition, $\beta_1^2 = \kappa_1^2/2$. From the scale principle, $\kappa_1^2 = R_e/r_1 = R_e/a_0$. Therefore:
\[ \beta_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} \frac{R_e}{a_0} \]
Substituting the expressions for $R_e$ and $a_0$:
\[ \beta_1^2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 m_e c^2} \right) \left( \frac{m_e e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 \hbar^2} \right) \]
The terms simplify to:
\[ \beta_1^2 = \frac{e^4}{(4\pi\varepsilon_0)^2 \hbar^2 c^2} = \left( \frac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 \hbar c} \right)^2 \]
We recognize the term in parentheses as the standard definition of the fine structure constant, $\alpha$.
\[ \beta_1^2 = \alpha^2 \implies \beta_1 = \alpha \]
The theorem is proven.
\end{proof}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Remark: A Derived Constant]
The fine structure constant has historically been regarded as a fundamental, dimensionless constant of nature whose value ($\approx 1/137$) is determined only by experiment. This derivation reveals its true identity: it is a \textbf{derived ratio of geometric projections}, fixed by the self-consistency requirements of the electron's relational geometry.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Emergence of Quantized Energy Levels}

The final piece of the atomic puzzle, the energy spectrum, now follows as a direct consequence of the derived geometry.

\begin{theorem}[Quantized Energy Levels]
The energy levels of the hydrogen atom are given by:
\[ E_n = -\frac{\alpha^2 m_e c^2}{2n^2} \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The total energy $E_n$ of a stable bound state is given by the virial theorem, which in our framework is a consequence of the geometric closure condition $\kappa_n^2=2\beta_n^2$. The theorem states $E_n = -K_n$. The kinetic energy budget is defined as $K_n = \frac{1}{2} m_e c^2 \beta_n^2$. Therefore:
\[ E_n = -\frac{1}{2} m_e c^2 \beta_n^2 \]
From the result $\beta_1 = \alpha$ and the quantization condition $p_n \propto 1/r_n \propto 1/n^2$, it follows that $p_n \propto 1/n$ and thus $\beta_n = \beta_1 / n = \alpha / n$. Substituting this into the energy expression gives the final result.
\end{proof}


\section{Conclusion}

By a rigorous application of the principles of WILL Relational Geometry, we have derived the complete structure of the hydrogen atom. We have demonstrated that quantization, the Bohr radius, the fine structure constant, and the discrete energy spectrum are not independent physical postulates but are all necessary and inevitable consequences of a single, unified principle: that reality is described by a closed, self-consistent relational geometry.

The framework requires no classical force analogues, no probabilistic axioms, and no external postulates. Atomic structure is shown to be a direct manifestation of the geometry of energy itself.
