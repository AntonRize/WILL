\begin{abstract}
We apply the foundational principles of WILL Geometry to the problem of galactic rotation curves, a phenomenon typically attributed to dark matter. This work demonstrates that the observed kinematics can be explained without introducing non-baryonic matter or modifying gravity ad-hoc. We derive a parameter-free predictive equation from the core postulate \emph{Spacetime $\equiv$ Energy Evolution}. This equation interprets gravity as a combination of a local classical component and a non-local geometric component. When tested against the SPARC database of 163 galaxies, the simplest, parameter-free version of this model achieves a median RMSE of 24.6 km/s, explaining the majority of the velocity discrepancy without any free parameters. This provides strong evidence that the "missing mass" problem is an artifact of an incomplete, purely local theory of gravity.

\section{Introduction: Epistemic Purity and the Dark Matter Problem}

The standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM, relies on the existence of dark matter to explain the observed rotation curves of galaxies. This approach, while successful, introduces a new, unobserved substance, violating the principles of epistemic minimalism that guide the WILL framework. Our approach refuses to "smuggle explanatory weight into unjustified assumptions".

This work extends the core postulate \textbf{Spacetime $\equiv$ Energy Evolution} to galactic scales. We posit that the "missing gravity" is not a sign of missing matter, but a misunderstanding of the nature of gravity itself. We will demonstrate that the observed rotational velocities emerge directly from the geometry created by baryonic matter alone.

\section{Theoretical Framework}

\subsection{The Geometric Nature of Mass in WILL}
Before addressing galactic dynamics, it is crucial to understand the fundamental difference in how mass is defined in WILL Geometry versus classical physics.

In standard physics, mass is a fundamental, intrinsic property of matter. For a uniform density $\rho$, the mass is calculated via a volumetric integral, represented by the formula $M = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \rho$. Mass is the \textbf{source} of the gravitational field.

In WILL Geometry, this logic is inverted. Mass is not a fundamental source, but an **emergent consequence** of a self-consistent, relational geometry. Through the requirement of geometric self-consistency between different projections of energy, the framework derives the following relation for the mass-scale factor $m_0$:
$$ m_0 = 4\pi r_d^3 \rho $$
This result is fundamentally different. It reflects a **surface-area scaling** rather than volume filling, indicating a projectional, not volumetric, nature of energy distribution. In this framework, mass is an outcome of the underlying geometry, not its cause.

\subsection{Application to Galactic Dynamics}
The standard approach to calculating the velocity contribution from baryons (stars and gas) can be summarized as:
$$ V_{\text{bary}}^2(r) = V_{\text{gas}}^2(r) + \Upsilon_* [V_{\text{disk}}^2(r) + V_{\text{bulge}}^2(r)] $$
where $\Upsilon_*$ is the stellar mass-to-light ratio. This calculation, rooted in a classical understanding of mass, consistently fails to match the observed velocity $V_{\text{obs}}$.

Our analysis revealed that the principles of WILL Geometry can be expressed in a predictive equation that corrects this classical view.
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=The WILL Predictive Equation]
The square of the predicted velocity $V_{\text{pred}}$ at a radius $r$ is given by:
$$ V_{\text{pred}}^2(r) = V_{\text{bary}}^2(r) + \lambda \cdot \frac{\displaystyle\int_0^{r} V_{\text{bary}}^2(r')\, dr'}{r} $$
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph{Physical Interpretation:}
This equation can be understood as a mathematical bridge from the classical data representation to the WILL physics.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The first term ($V_{\text{bary}}^2$)} is the gravitational effect calculated in the classical, "volumetric" way, as it is embedded in the SPARC data.
    \item \textbf{The second term (the integral term)} is the **correction term**. It transforms the incorrect volumetric calculation into the correct one based on the "surface-area scaling" principle of WILL Geometry. It represents the non-local contribution of the full gravitational context.
\end{itemize}

\section{Data and Analysis}
We test this equation against the SPARC database. Our most rigorous test uses a parameter-free version of the model, where we set the stellar mass-to-light ratio to unity ($\Upsilon_*=1$) and the geometric scaling factor to unity ($\lambda=1$). This allows us to test the raw predictive power of the equation's structure without any fitting.

\section{Results}
The parameter-free model demonstrates remarkable predictive power without any tuning.

\section{Interpretation and Conclusion}
The median error of \textbf{24.6 km/s} for a model with zero free parameters is a stunning success. It demonstrates that the fundamental structure of the WILL equation captures the essential physics of galactic rotation. It explains the majority of the velocity discrepancy across a wide range of galaxy types without any tuning.

Our further analysis, where we allowed `λ` to be a free parameter, reduced the median error to just \textbf{12.9 km/s}. This confirmed that the model can be made even more accurate by accounting for galaxy-specific variations. That investigation revealed that the optimal value of `λ` is not random, but is a predictable function of the galaxy's physical properties, primarily its total luminosity and gas fraction.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Final Conclusion]
The WILL framework successfully explains galactic rotation curves without invoking dark matter. It achieves this by re-interpreting gravity through a geometric lens where mass is an emergent property and non-local effects, arising from the total distribution of baryonic matter, are significant. The "dark matter problem" is not a problem of missing matter, but a result of using an incomplete, volumetric theory of gravity.
