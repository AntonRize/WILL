\begin{description}

\item[$\beta$ (Beta):] The kinetic projection in WILL Geometry, representing the ratio of an object's velocity to the universal speed of evolution \((v/c)\). It quantifies how much of the "speed of change" is perceived as motion through space relative to observer. Not an intrinsic property of an object but rather a measure of the differences between states, perceived from the perspective of an observer.

\item[$c$ (Universal Speed of Evolution):] The fundamental, invariant tempo of change in the universe. It is not merely the speed of light but the constant rate at which all energetic interactions and transformations occur.

\item[Conservation Law:] The principle stating that the total energy of the universe must remain constant. In WILL Geometry, this is a direct logical consequence of the universe being a closed and self-sufficient system.

\item[Critical Density \((\rho_{\max})\):] A local, finite limit on how much energy can be packed into a given point in space, dependent on central mass and the distance from it center. In WILL Geometry, this prevents the formation of infinite densities (singularities).

\item[Energy–Momentum Triangle:] A geometric visualization in WILL Geometry that depicts the relationship between an object's rest energy, momentum, and total energy as the sides of a right triangle, illustrating their constant interconnectedness.

\item[Energy–Symmetry Law:] The principle in WILL Geometry stating that energy differences observed between any two frames of reference will always perfectly balance out, ensuring no "extra" energy is created or lost, and thus enforcing causality and naturally explains why any spacial motion limited by speed of light.

\item[Epistemological Hygiene:] A guiding principle that demands the rejection of all assumptions not strictly necessary, building the theory solely on logical sequence from a minimalist foundation.

\item[Event Horizon:] The boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape. In WILL Geometry, \(\kappa = 1\) at this point, indicating that the escape venosity here is equal to speed of light.

\item[Geometric Structures (Circle \(S^1\) and Sphere \(S^2\)):] The fundamental, non spacial, maximally symmetric and closed geometric "canvases" on which physical reality is projected in WILL Geometry. The circle describes 1D unidirectional motion (Special Relativity), and the sphere describes 2D omnidirectional gravity (General Relativity).

\item[$\kappa$ (Kappa):] The gravitational projection in WILL Geometry. It measures how deeply an object is situated within a gravitational field, relative to an observer, and indicates proximity to an event horizon. Not an intrinsic property of an object but rather a measure of the differences between states, perceived from the perspective of an observer.

\item[Photon Sphere:] A specific region around a massive object where light can orbit in a perfect, unstable circular path. In WILL Geometry, this corresponds to a braking point where the sum of kinetic and potential projections are reaching unity \((Q^2=\kappa^{2} + \beta^{2} = 1)\).

\item[Relational View of Energy:] The concept in WILL Geometry that energy is not an intrinsic property of an object but rather a measure of the differences between states, perceived from the perspective of an observer.

\item[Singularity:] A point of infinite density predicted by traditional General Relativity (e.g., at the center of a black hole). WILL Geometry's framework inherently prevents singularities, replacing them with finite, maximum allowed densities.

\item[\( \text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION} \):] The central, unifying postulate of WILL Geometry, asserting that the fabric of spacetime is identical to the full structure of all possible transitions and interconnections between energetic states.

\item[Symmetry:] A core principle in WILL Geometry derived from the postulate, stating that in a closed system without external reference points, the geometry of the universe must be maximally symmetric. No preferred directions.

\item[Time/Length Dilation/Contraction:] The phenomenon where time passes more slowly for an observer or object. In WILL Geometry, it is explained as a consequence of how the universal "speed of evolution" budget is allocated between motion (kinetic time dilation) and gravitational potential (gravitational time dilation).

\item[WILL Invariant \((W_{\text{ill}})\):] A dimensionless constant \((=1)\) that mathematically connects energy, mass, time, and length within the WILL Geometry framework, demonstrating the self-consistency of the system.

\section{Key Equations Reference}

This section serves as a convenient reference for the core equations and relationships of the Energy Geometry framework.

\subsection{Fundamental Parameters}

\begin{align}
   \textbf{Kinematic projection} \quad  \beta &=  \frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{2r_{d}}} = \sqrt{\frac{Gm_0}{r_{d}c^2}} = \cos\left(\theta_S\right), \quad \text{(Velocity Like)} \\
 \textbf{Potential projection} \quad  \kappa &= \frac{v_e}{c} = \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{r_{d}}} = \sqrt{\frac{2Gm_0}{r_{d}c^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\rho}{\rho_{max}}}= \sin\left(\theta_G\right),\quad \text{(Escape Velocity Like)}

\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\kappa^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{c^2} r_{d}^2 \rho(r).
\end{equation}
\[
\kappa^{2}(r)=\dfrac{2G m(r)}{c^{2} r}
\]
\[
\dfrac{d}{dr}\!\bigl(\kappa^{2}r\bigr)=\dfrac{8\pi G}{c^{2}}r^{2}\rho(r)

\end{align}

\subsection{Energy Density and Pressure}

\begin{align}
    \rho &= \frac{\kappa^2 c^2}{8\pi G r_{d}^2} = \kappa^2 \cdot \rho_{max} \\
    \rho_{max} &= \frac{c^2}{8\pi G r_{d}^2} \quad \text{(Critical energy density where $\kappa=1$ event horizon)} \\
    P(r_{d}) &= - \frac{c^2}{8\pi G} \cdot \frac{1}{r_{d}} \cdot \frac{d\kappa^2}{dr_{d}} \quad \text{(Pressure)}
\end{align}

    T_d &= \frac{1}{L_c} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}} \quad \text{(Relativistic time dilation)} \\
    L_d &= \frac{1}{T_c} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\kappa^2}} \quad \text{(Gravitational length dilation)}
\end{align}

\subsection{Combined Energy Parameter $Q$}

\text{The total energy projection parameter unifies both aspects:}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
    Q &=\sqrt{\kappa^2 + \beta^2}  \\
    Q^{2}&= 3\beta^2 = \frac{3}{2}\kappa^2 = \frac{3R_s}{2r_{d}} \\
    Q_t &= \sqrt{1-Q^2} = \sqrt{1-\kappa^2-\beta^2} = \sqrt{1-3\beta^2} = \sqrt{1-\frac{3}{2}\kappa^2} \\

\end{align}
\begin{align}
\boxed{\;
   \frac{d}{dr}\bigl(\kappa^{2}r\bigr)
   =\frac{8\pi G}{c^{2}} r^{2}\rho(r)
\;}
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\kappa^{2}(r)=\frac{2G}{c^{2}}\frac{m(r)}{r}.
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\text{For the homogeneous layer ($\kappa=\text{const}$) this reduces to}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\rho(r)=\frac{\kappa^{2}c^{2}}{(8\pi G r^{2})},
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\text{exactly matching the global algebraic form used in Table 1.}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\text{These describe the combined effects of relativity and gravity.}
\end{align}

\subsection{Fundamental WILL Invariant}
