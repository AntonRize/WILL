In WILL Relational Geometry, \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) are not spatial entities existing within a pre-defined container. They are the necessary relational architectures that implement the core identity \(\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY}\).


Recall that energy is defined as the relational measure of difference between possible states. It is not an intrinsic property but a relational potential for change. It is never observed directly, only through transformations.

The Carriers \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) are the minimal, unique mathematical structures capable of hosting this relational "bookkeeping" for directional and omnidirectional transformations, respectively. They enforce closure, conservation, and symmetry by their very topology.

Imagine two observers, \(A\) and \(B\):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Observer \(A\) is the center of their own relational framework. Observer \(B\) is a point on \(A\)'s \(S^1\) (for kinematic relations) and \(S^2\) (for gravitational relations).
    \item Simultaneously, observer \(B\) is the center of their own framework. Observer \(A\) is a point on \(B\)'s \(S^1\) and \(S^2\).
\end{itemize}
There is no privileged "master" carrier. Each observable interaction is structured by these mutually-centered relational protocols. The parameters \(\beta\) and \(\kappa\) are the coordinates within these relational dimensions, and the conservation laws (e.g., \(\beta^2 + \beta_Y^2 = 1; \quad \kappa_X^2 + \kappa^2 = 1\)) are the innate accounting rules of these protocols.


The orthogonal decomposition of the relational carriers $S^1$ and $S^2$ reveals a functional duality. Every physical state is a superposition of two projections:

\begin{definition}[The Amplitude Projection (External Interaction)]
Denoted by $\beta$ (kinematic) and $\kappa$ (gravitational).
This component measures the \textit{extent of external relation}. It manifests as momentum or potential intensity. Physically, it represents the system's relational "shift" from the \textbf{Observer's relational Origin} (the rest frame).
\[
\text{Amplitude} \to \text{External Power (Kinetic/Potential)}
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[The Phase Projection (Internal Evolution)]
Denoted by $\beta_Y$ and $\kappa_X$.
This component measures the internal ordering. It governs the intrinsic scale of proper time and proper length. A Phase of 1 represents maximal internal flow (rest/vacuum), while a Phase of 0 represents the cessation of internal causality (light-speed/horizon).
    \[
    \text{Phase} \to \text{Internal Order (Time/Structure)}
    \]
\end{definition}


For both kinematic ($S^1$) and gravitational ($S^2$) modes, the sum of the squared Amplitude and squared Phase is invariant:
\begin{equation}
\underbrace{\text{Amplitude}^2}_{\text{External Interaction}} + \underbrace{\text{Phase}^2}_{\text{Internal Existence}} = 1
\end{equation}


Physical Interpretation: Relativistic Effects

The conservation law of Theorem (Universal Conservation of Relation) implies that any redistribution between 
the orthogonal components $\underbrace{\text{Amplitude}^2}_{\text{External Interaction}} + \underbrace{\text{Phase}^2}_{\text{Internal Existence}} = 1$ manifests physically as the relativistic effects of time dilation and length contraction.

By Theorem (Universal Conservation of Relation) the components satisfy $\left(\right. \beta^{2} + \beta_{Y}^{2} = 1 \left.\right)$; $\left(\right. \kappa^{2} + \kappa_{X}^{2} = 1 \left.\right)$. 
An increase in Amplitude ($\beta, \kappa$) enforces a decrease in Phase measure ($\beta_Y, \kappa_X$). 
This reduction of $\beta_{Y} , \kappa_{X}$ corresponds to dilation of proper time and contraction of proper length, 
while the growth of $\beta , \kappa$ represents momentum/potential. 
Thus the relativistic and gravitational trade-off is the direct physical expression of the geometric closure of $S^1$and $S^2$ relational carriers.  



Geometry of spacetime is the shadow cast by the geometry of relations.

\end{figure}


Every observer performs self--centering:
\[
(\beta,\kappa)=(0,0).
\]
When I observe another system, I assign to it $(\beta,\kappa)$ and therefore a
total shift
\[
Q^2=\beta^2+\kappa^2.
\]
When that system observes me, it again self--centres and obtains the same form.
It assigns to me some $(\beta,\kappa)$ and again computes $Q^2=\beta^2+\kappa^2$.

Reciprocity is therefore not a vector symmetry in a shared space. It is a
symmetry of the \emph{self--centering operation}: each observer applies the same
rule and only the norm of shift is invariant.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary]
\[
\boxed{\text{Relational reciprocity} \;=\; \text{invariance of the norm $Q$ under self--centering}.}
\]
There is no common background arena. There are only mutual total shift
magnitudes $Q$ computed in each observer's own relational origin.
