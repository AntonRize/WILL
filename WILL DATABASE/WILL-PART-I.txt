\begin{abstract}
This paper, the first in the WILL series, establishes \textit{Relational Geometry} - a foundational framework where spacetime is not a background arena but an emergent property of energy transformations. 

From a single principle \textbf{SPACETIME $\equiv$ ENERGY}, we derive the complete geometric structure of physics. This equivalence is not postulated but derived by removing the hidden ontological assumption in modern physics that structure (spacetime) and dynamics (energy) are separate phenomena. 

The result is a singularity-free, ontologically clean formalism that reproduces the core equations of Special Relativity (SR) and General Relativity (GR) as algebraic projections on closed relational manifolds $S^1$ (directional) and $S^2$ (omnidirectional). Without metrics, tensors, or free parameters, it reproduces Lorentz factors, the energy-momentum relation, Schwarzschild solutions, and Einstein field equations via dimensionless projections $\beta$ (kinematic) and $\kappa$ (gravitational). Critical features - photon sphere, ISCO, horizons - emerge as equilibria ($\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$, $Q^2 = \kappa^2 + \beta^2 = 1$). Empirically validated (e.g., GPS time shift 38.52 $\mu$s/day, Mercury precession to $10^{-10}$\%).

WILL Part I resolves GR's singularities (bounded $\rho_{\max}$) and local energy ambiguity, offering significant computational simplification establishing a robust foundation for subsequent papers on cosmology (Part II) and quantum mechanics (Part III).

\section{Foundational Approach}
\begin{quote}
  \textit{This Approach Does not Describe Physics; it Generates it. \ref{Generative Physics}}
\end{quote}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Guiding Principle:]
\textbf{Nothing is assumed. Everything is derived.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection {Methodological Purity}
This framework is constructed under a single epistemic constraint: to derive all of physics by \textbf{removing one hidden assumption}, rather than introducing new postulates. This construction is deliberate and contains zero free parameters.  This is not a simplification - it is a deliberate epistemic constraint. No assumptions are introduced unless they follow strictly from first principles, and no constructs are retained unless they are geometrically or energetically necessary. 

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Core Methodological Principle]
\begin{principle}[Methodological Minimalism]
\label{pr:minimalism}
Any fundamental theory must proceed from the minimum possible number of ontological assumptions. The burden of proof lies with any assertion that introduces additional complexity or new entities. This principle is not a statement about the nature of reality, but a rule of logical hygiene for constructing a theory.
\end{principle}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{No Ontological Commitments}
This model makes no ontological claims about the "existence" of space, particles, or fields. Instead, all phenomena are treated as observer-dependent relational projections.

\subsection{Epistemic Hygiene}
Modern physics often tolerates hidden assumptions: arbitrary constants, external backgrounds, or abstract entities with ambiguous physical status. 
Here we enforce \textbf{epistemic hygiene}: a refusal to import unjustified assumptions. 

\textbf{Principle:} \emph{All physical quantities must be defined purely by their relations.} 
Any introduction of absolute properties or external frames risks reintroducing metaphysical artifacts and contradicts the foundational insight of relativity.

\section{False Separation: Ontological Blind Spot In Modern Physics}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Removing the Hidden Assumption]
Any attempt to treat \emph{``spacetime structure''} as separate from \emph{``dynamics''} smuggles in a background container that is not justified by the phenomena. This violates epistemic hygiene: it introduces an ontological artifact without necessity. Eliminating this separation compels the identification of structure and dynamics as two aspects of a single entity.
\end{tcolorbox}

The standard formulation of General Relativity often relies on the concept of an asymptotically flat spacetime, introducing an implicit external reference frame beyond the physical systems under study. 
While some modern approaches (e.g., shape dynamics) seek greater relationality, we proceed from strict epistemic minimalism, disallowing all background structures, even hidden or asymptotic ones. 

\section{False Separation: the Ontological Blind-Spot of Modern Physics}


\subsection*{Historical Pattern: breakthroughs delete, not add}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Copernicus} eliminated the Earth/cosmos separation.
  \item \textbf{Newton} eliminated the terrestrial/celestial law separation.
  \item \textbf{Einstein} eliminated the space/time separation.
  \item \textbf{Maxwell} eliminated the electricity/magnetism separation.
\end{itemize}
Each step widened the relational circle and reduced the number of
unexplained absolutes.  The spacetime--energy split is the only
survivor of this pruning sequence.

\subsection*{The contemporary split: an unpaid ontological bill}
All present-day theories (SR, GR, QFT, ΛCDM, Standard Model) are
built with a \emph{bi-variable} syntax:
\[
\underbrace{\text{fixed manifold + metric}}_{\text{structure}}
\quad+\quad
\underbrace{\text{fields + constants}}_{\text{dynamics}}.
\]
No observation demands this duplication; it is retained purely
because the resulting Lagrangians are empirically adequate
\emph{inside} the split.  The split is therefore \emph{not} an
empirical discovery but an unpaid ontological debt.

\subsection*{Empirical bankruptcy of the separation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Local energy conservation} verified only \emph{after} the
        metric is declared fixed; no experiment varies the \emph{volume} of
        flat space and checks calorimetry.
  \item \textbf{Universality of free fall} tests $m_i=m_g$ numerically, not
        the claim that inertia resides \emph{in} the object rather than in
        a geometric scaling relation.
  \item \textbf{Gravitational-wave polarisations} test spin content, not
        ontology; extra modes can still be called ``matter on spacetime''.
  \item \textbf{Casimir/Lamb shift} measure \emph{differences} of vacuum
        energy between two geometries; the absolute bulk term is explicitly
        subtracted, leaving the split intact.
\end{itemize}
In short, every ``test'' is an \emph{internal consistency check} of
a formalism that already presupposes two substances.  None constitute
\emph{positive evidence} for the split.

\subsection*{Consequence}
Until an experiment varies the amount of space while holding
everything else fixed, the spacetime--energy separation remains an
\emph{un-evidenced metaphysical postulate}---the last geocentric
epicycle in physics (hopefully).

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary]
Every major advance in physics has come \emph{not} from adding new
ontological furniture but from \emph{removing} a false separation.\\
Today’s silent assumption - that ``spacetime structure'' and
``energy/dynamics'' are two distinct substances - is the last such
artifact (hopefully).  It survives only because no experiment has ever varied the
amount of space while holding everything else constant.
\end{tcolorbox}


\section{Unifying Principle Removing the Hidden Assumption}

\subsection{False Separation}
\begin{lemma}[False Separation]
\label{lem:false-separation}
Any model that treats processes as unfolding \emph{within} an independent background necessarily assigns to that background structural features (metric, orientation, or frame) not derivable from the relations among the processes themselves. Such a background constitutes an \emph{extraneous absolute}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose an independent background exists. Then at least one of its structural attributes - metric relations, a preferred orientation, or a class of inertial frames - remains fixed regardless of interprocess data. This attribute is not relationally inferred but posited a priori. It thereby violates the relational closure principle: it introduces a non-relational absolute external to the system. Hence the separation is illicit.  
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Structure--Dynamics Coincidence]
\label{cor:coincidence}
To avoid the artifact of Lemma~\ref{lem:false-separation}, the structural arena and the dynamical content must be identified: geometry \emph{is} energy, and energy \emph{is} geometry.
\end{corollary}
    
\begin{principle}[Working Principle: Removing the Hidden Assumption]
\label{pr:unifying}
\[
\boxed{\textbf{SPACETIME} \;\equiv\; \textbf{ENERGY}}
\]
This is not introduced as a new ontological entity but as a Principle with 
\emph{negative ontological weight}: it removes the hidden unjustified separation 
between “geometry” and “dynamics.” Space and time are not containers but 
emergent descriptors of relational energy.
\end{principle}

\begin{remark}[Auditability]
Principle~\ref{pr:unifying} is foundational but testable: it is subject to (i) geometric audit (internal logical consequences) and (ii) empirical audit (agreement with empirical data).
\end{remark}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary:]
\textbf{This Principle does not add, it subtracts: it removes the hidden assumption.  Structure and dynamics are two aspects of a single entity - WILL.}
\end{tcolorbox}


\subsection{What is Energy in Relational Framework?}
\begin{quote}
Across all domains of physics, one empirical fact persists: in every closed system there exists a quantity that never disappears or arises spontaneously, but only transforms in form. This invariant is observed under many guises --- kinetic, potential, thermal, quantum --- yet all are interchangeable, pointing to a single underlying structure.
Crucially, this quantity is never observed directly, but only through \textit{differences between states}: a change of velocity, a shift in configuration, a transition of phase. Its value is relational, not absolute: it depends on the chosen frame or comparison, never on an object in isolation.
Moreover, this quantity provides continuity of causality. If it changes in one part of the system, a complementary change must occur elsewhere, ensuring the unbroken chain of transitions. Thus it is the bookkeeping of causality itself.
From these empirical and relational facts the definition follows unavoidably:
\end{quote}
\[
\begin{array}{c} \boxed{ 
\begin{array}{c} 
\text{Energy is the relational measure of difference between possible states,} \\
\text{ conserved in any closed whole and guaranteeing the continuity of causal transitions.} \\ 
\text{It is not an intrinsic property of an object, but }\textbf{ comparative structure}\\ 
\text{ between states (and observers), always manifesting as transformation. }
\end{array} 
} \end{array}
\]


\section{Deriving the WILL Structure}

Having established our working Principle (Principle \textbackslash{}ref\{pr:unifying\}) by removing the illicit separation of structure and dynamics, we now proceed to derive its necessary geometric and physical consequences. We will demonstrate that this single principle is sufficient to enforce the closure, conservation, and fundamental symmetries of the relational structure, leading to a unique set of geometric carriers for energy.

\begin{definition}[WILL Geometry]
\label{def:will}
\emph{$ \textbf{WILL}\equiv\ \textbf{SPACE-TIME-ENERGY} $} is the technical term we use for unified relational structure determined by \ref{pr:unifying} . All physically meaningful quantities are relational features of WILL; no external container is permitted.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Closure]
\label{lem:closure}
Under  \ref{pr:unifying}, WILL is self-contained: there is no external reservoir into or from which the relational resource can flow.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If WILL were not self-contained, there would exist an external structure mediating exchange. That external structure would then serve as a background distinct from the dynamics, contradicting Corollary~\ref{cor:coincidence}.  
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Conservation]
\label{lem:conservation}
Within WILL, the total relational ``transformation resource'' (energy) is conserved.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Lemma~\ref{lem:closure}, no external fluxes exist. Any change in one part of WILL must be balanced by complementary change elsewhere. Hence a conserved global quantity is enforced at the relational level.  
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Isotropy from Background--Free Relationality]
\label{lem:isotropy}
If no external background is allowed (Cor.~\ref{cor:coincidence}), then no direction can be \emph{a priori} privileged. Thus the admissible relational geometry of WILL must be maximally symmetric (isotropic and homogeneous) at the level at which it encodes the conserved resource.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
A privileged direction requires an extrinsic reference to distinguish it. In a purely relational setting, distinctions must be constructible from relations internal to WILL. If a direction were privileged in the geometry that encodes the conserved resource, such privilege would not be derivable from purely internal comparisons (which are symmetric by construction), and would reintroduce an external orienting structure. Therefore the encoding geometry must be maximally symmetric.  
\end{proof}

\subsection{Classification of Minimal Relational Transformations}

The lemmas of Closure, Conservation, and Isotropy establish the necessary properties of any geometric carrier of the relational resource. To identify these carriers, we must first classify the simplest possible types of physical relations that can exist in a background-free framework, according to the Principle of Methodological Minimalism (\ref{pr:minimalism}).

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Directional (Kinematic) Relation:}
    The simplest possible non-trivial relation is between two distinct states (A and B). The minimal description of this directed relation requires only a single degree of freedom (the axis connecting A and B). Per Principle~\ref{pr:minimalism}, introducing additional dimensions would be an unjustified complication. For this description to be self-contained (Lemma~\ref{lem:closure}), the 1D geometry must be closed. This uniquely specifies the circle ($S^1$) as the necessary and sufficient carrier for minimal directional relations.

    \item \textbf{Omnidirectional (Gravitational) Relation:}
    The simplest possible isotropic relation is between a central state (A) and the locus of all states equidistant to it. The minimal description for all directions of this relation requires a surface representing all possible orientations from the center. Such a surface has two degrees of freedom (corresponding to the two angles needed to specify a direction). For this description to be closed and maximally symmetric (Lemmas~\ref{lem:closure}, \ref{lem:isotropy}), the geometry must be that of a 2-sphere ($S^2$). It is the necessary and sufficient carrier for minimal omnidirectional relations.
\end{enumerate}

The Principle of Methodological Minimalism thus restricts the admissible relational geometries to these two minimal classes. The following theorem provides their formal identification.

\begin{theorem}[Minimal Relational Carriers of the Conserved Resource]
\label{thm:carriers}
The only closed, maximally symmetric manifolds that can serve as minimal carriers of the conserved relational resource are:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item \(S^1\) for \emph{directional} (one-degree-of-freedom) relational transformation;
        \item \(S^2\) for \emph{omnidirectional} (central, all-directions-equivalent) relational transformation.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By Lemma~\ref{lem:isotropy}, we require closed, maximally symmetric manifolds. 

(a) In one relational degree of freedom, the classification of connected closed $1$-manifolds yields \(S^1\) as the unique (up to diffeomorphism) option. Its isometry group acts transitively with isotropy at each point, providing maximal symmetry.

(b) For omnidirectional relational transformation from a distinguished center, the encoding manifold must be a closed, simply connected, constant positive curvature $2$-manifold with full isotropy at every point. By the uniformization/classification of constant-curvature surfaces, the maximally symmetric representative is \(S^2\). Quotients of \(S^2\) by nontrivial finite groups introduce global identifications that spoil global isotropy; these are excluded by Lemma~\ref{lem:isotropy}. Hence \(S^2\) is uniquely selected.  
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Uniqueness]
\label{cor:uniqueness}
Under \ref{pr:unifying} with Closure, Conservation, and Isotropy (Lemmas \ref{lem:closure}--\ref{lem:isotropy}), \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) are \emph{necessary} relational carriers for, respectively, directional and omnidirectional modes of energy transformation.
\end{corollary}

\begin{remark}[Non-spatial Reading]
\label{rem:nonspatial}
Throughout, \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) are not to be interpreted as \emph{spacetime} geometries. They are \emph{relational manifolds} that encode the closure, conservation, and isotropy of the transformational resource. Ordinary spatial and temporal notions are emergent descriptors of patterns within WILL.
\end{remark}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary:]
From removing the hidden assumption ~\ref{lem:false-separation} we inevitably arrive to \ref{pr:unifying}   \(\text{SPACETIME}\equiv\text{ENERGY}\) from there we deduced: (i) closure, (ii) conservation, (iii) isotropy, and hence (iv) the unique selection of \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) as minimal relational carriers for directional and omnidirectional transformation. These objects are non-spatial encodings of conservation and symmetry; they are enforced by the\ref{pr:unifying} rather than assumed independently.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Ontological Status of the Relational Manifolds \(S^1\) and \(S^2\)}

A natural question arises regarding the ontological status of the circle \(S^1\) and the sphere \(S^2\): What are they, and where do they "exist"?

The answer requires a fundamental shift in perspective. In WILL Geometry, \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) are \textbf{not spatial entities} existing within a pre-defined container. They are the necessary \textbf{relational architectures} that implement the core identity \(\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY}\).

\paragraph{Energy as Relational Bookkeeping}
Recall that energy is defined as the \textit{relational measure of difference between possible states}. It is not an intrinsic property but a comparative structure that guarantees causal continuity. It is never observed directly, only through transformations.

\paragraph{The Manifolds as Protocols of Interaction}
The manifolds \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) are the minimal, unique mathematical structures capable of hosting this relational "bookkeeping" for directional and omnidirectional transformations, respectively. They enforce closure, conservation, and symmetry by their very topology.

Imagine two observers, \(A\) and \(B\):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Observer \(A\) is the center of their own relational framework. Observer \(B\) is a point on \(A\)'s \(S^1\) (for kinematic relations) and \(S^2\) (for gravitational relations).
    \item Simultaneously, observer \(B\) is the center of their own framework. Observer \(A\) is a point on \(B\)'s \(S^1\) and \(S^2\).
\end{itemize}
There is no privileged "master" manifold. Each observable interaction is structured by these mutually-centered relational protocols. The parameters \(\beta\) and \(\kappa\) are the coordinates within these relational dimensions, and the conservation laws (e.g., \(\beta_X^2 + \beta_Y^2 = 1; \quad \kappa_X^2 + \kappa_Y^2 = 1\)) are the innate accounting rules of these protocols.

\paragraph{Emergence of Spacetime}
Therefore, the question "Where are \(S^1\) and \(S^2\)?" is a category error. They are not \textit{in} space; they are the structures whose coordinated, multi-centered interactions \textbf{give rise to} the phenomenon we perceive as spacetime. Spacetime is the emergent, collective shadow cast by the dynamics of energy relations projected onto these architectures.

In essence, \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) are the ontological embodiment of the relational principle. They are derived as the only possible structures that can house the transformational resource (energy) in a closed, conserved, and isotropic system. Their status is that of a fundamental \textbf{relational geometry} from which physics is generated.

\section{Emergence of Spacetime}

\textit{In this construction, ``space,'' ``time,'' are not treated as separate, fundamental aspects of reality. Instead, they are shown to arise as necessary consequences of a single, underlying principle: the geometry of a closed, relational system.}

\subsection{The Duality of Transformation}

\begin{lemma}[Duality of Evolution]
\label{lem:duality}
The identification of spacetime with energy and its transformations necessitates two complementary relational measures:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the \textbf{extent} of transformation (external displacement), and
    \item the \textbf{sequence} of transformation (internal order).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Any complete description of transformation must specify both what changes and how that change is internally ordered. A single measure cannot capture both. The circle $S^1$ provides the minimal geometry enforcing such complementarity: its orthogonal projections furnish precisely two non-redundant coordinates.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{ We define this orthogonal projections as follows:}

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{The Amplitude Component ($\beta_X$):} This projection represents the \textit{relational measure} between the system and the observer. It corresponds to the \textit{extent} of transformation, which manifests physically as momentum (as shown in next section).

    \item \textbf{The Phase Component ($\beta_Y$):} This projection represents the \textit{internal structure} of a system. It governs the intrinsic scale of its proper space and proper time units, corresponding to the \textit{sequence} of its transformation. A value of $\beta_Y=1$ represents a complete and undisturbed manifestation of this internal structure, a state we identify as rest.


\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conservation Law of Relational Transformation}

\begin{theorem}[Conservation Law of Relational transformation]
\label{thm:conservation}
The orthogonal components of transformation $(\beta_X,\beta_Y)$ are bound by the closure relation
\[
\beta_X^2 + \beta_Y^2 = 1.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Since $S^1$ is closed, every point on the circle is constrained by the Pythagorean identity of its projections. Thus no state can exceed or fall short of the finite relational "budget." This closure enforces conservation across all processes. 
\end{proof}

The manifestation of any system is distributed between its internal (Phase) and relational (Amplitude) aspects. This single geometric constraint gives rise to the core phenomena of modern physics:

\subsection{Consequence: Relativistic Effects}

\begin{proposition}[Physical Interpretation: Relativistic Effects]
\label{prop:relativity}
The conservation law of Theorem~\ref{thm:conservation} implies that any redistribution between 
the orthogonal components $(\beta_X,\beta_Y)$ manifests physically as the relativistic effects of 
time dilation and length contraction.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{thm:conservation}, the components satisfy $\beta_X^2 + \beta_Y^2 = 1$. 
An increase in the relational displacement $\beta_X$ enforces a decrease in the internal measure $\beta_Y$. 
This reduction of $\beta_Y$ corresponds to dilation of proper time and contraction of proper length, 
while the growth of $\beta_X$ represents momentum. 
Thus the relativistic trade-off is not an additional postulate but the direct physical expression 
of the geometric closure of $S^1$.  
\end{proof}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary:]
\textbf{Geometry of spacetime is nothing but the shadow cast by the geometry of relations.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Kinetic Energy Projection on $S^1$}

Since $S^{1}$ encodes one-dimensional displacement, the total energy $E$ of the system 
must project consistently onto both axes:
\[
E_{X} = E \beta_{X}, 
\qquad 
E_{Y} = E \beta_{Y}.
\]

\begin{theorem}[Invariant Projection of Rest Energy]
\label{thm:restenergy}
For any state $(\beta_X,\beta_Y)$ on the relational circle, the vertical projection of the total energy is invariant:
\[
E \beta_Y = E_0.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
When $\beta_X=0$, closure enforces $\beta_Y=1$, yielding $E=E_0$. 
Since closure applies for all $\theta_1$, the vertical projection $E\beta_Y$ 
remains equal to this rest value in every state.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Total Energy Relation]
\label{cor:totalE}
From Theorem~\ref{thm:restenergy} it follows that
\[
E = \frac{E_0}{\beta_Y} 
= \frac{E_0}{\sqrt{\,1-\beta_X^2\,}}.
\]
\end{corollary}

\begin{remark}[Lorentz Factor]
The historical Lorentz factor $\gamma$ is nothing more than the reciprocal of $\beta_Y$. 
No additional structure is introduced: all content is already present in $E\beta_Y=E_0$.
\end{remark}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary:]
\textbf{The historical Lorentz factor $\gamma$ is nothing more than the reciprocal of $\beta_Y$.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Rest Energy and Mass Equivalence}

\begin{corollary}[Rest Energy and Mass Equivalence]
\label{cor:restmass}
Within the normalization $c=1$, the invariant rest energy equals mass:
\[
E_{0} = m.
\]
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
From the invariant projection $E\beta_Y = E_0$ and closure of $S^1$, no additional scaling parameter is required. 
Hence the conventional bookkeeping identities $E_0 = mc^2$ or $m = E_0/c^2$ reduce to tautologies. 
Mass is therefore not independent, but the rest-energy invariant itself.  
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Epistemic Interpretation]
In a framework that is genuinely fundamental and free from arbitrary human units, 
the natural normalization is always the unique invariant $c=1$. 
With this normalization, the bookkeeping identities $E_0=mc^2$ or $m=E_0/c^2$ lose all significance. 
They collapse into the only consistent statement:
\[
E_{0} = m.
\]

Thus mass is nothing beyond the invariant projection of total rest energy. 
It introduces no new entity and carries no independent meaning apart from $E_0$. 
What is conventionally treated as two quantities is in fact one and the same relational invariant.
\end{remark}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary:]
\textbf{Mass is nothing beyond the invariant projection of total rest energy. .}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Energy--Momentum Relation}

\begin{proposition}[Horizontal Projection as Momentum]
\label{prop:momentum}
On the relational circle, the unique relational measure of displacement from rest is the horizontal projection $E\beta_X$; hence
\[
p \equiv E\beta_X \quad (c=1).
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The rest state is $(\beta_X,\beta_Y)=(0,1)$. A displacement measure must (i) vanish at rest, (ii) grow monotonically with $|\beta_X|$, and (iii) flip sign under $\beta_X\mapsto -\beta_X$. The only relational candidate satisfying (i)–(iii) is the horizontal projection $E\beta_X$. Thus the identification is necessary rather than conventional.  
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Energy--Momentum Relation]
\label{cor:energymomentum}
With $p$ identified by Proposition~\ref{prop:momentum} and $m=E_0$, the closure identity yields
\[
E^{2} = p^{2} + m^{2} \quad (c=1).
\]
Equivalently, upon restoring $c$,
\[
E^{2} = (pc)^{2} + (mc^{2})^{2}.
\]
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
By closure, $(E\beta_X)^2 + (E\beta_Y)^2 = E^2$. Substituting $p=E\beta_X$ and $m=E_0$ proves the claim. 
Restoring $c$ is dimensional bookkeeping: $p\mapsto pc$ and $m\mapsto mc^{2}$, while $E$ remains $E$, yielding the standard form. 
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Geometric Forms]
The same identity may be expressed explicitly in terms of circle coordinates:
\[
E^{2} = \left(\tfrac{\beta_X}{\beta_Y}E_0\right)^{2} + E_0^{2}
= \bigl(\cot(\theta_{1})\,E_{0}\bigr)^{2} + E_{0}^{2}.
\]
These are not alternative parametrizations, but equivalent renderings 
of the same geometric necessity.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Units sanity check — bookkeeping]
Using $\beta_X = v/c$, the identification $p \equiv E\beta_X$ gives
\[
pc = E\,\frac{v}{c}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad p = \frac{E\,v}{c^{2}}.
\]
With $E=\frac{1}{\beta_Y} mc^{2}=\gamma mc^{2}$ this reduces to $p=\frac{\beta_X}{\beta_Y}mc=\gamma m v$, the standard relativistic momentum. No new parameters are introduced.
\end{remark}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary:]
\textbf{The energy--momentum relation $E^{2}=p^{2}+m^{2}$ is nothing more then geometric identity of $S^1$.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Potential Energy Projection on $S^2$}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=IMPORTANT:]
\textbf{Throughout this work, $S^1$ and $S^2$ are not to be interpreted as spacetime geometries but purely as relational manifolds encoding conservation. Any reading otherwise is a misinterpretation.}
\end{tcolorbox}

Analogous to $S^1$ the relational geometry of the sphere, $S^2$, provides orthogonal projections,  for two aspects of omnidirectional transformation. We define them as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Amplitude Component ($\kappa_Y$):} This projection represents the \textit{relational gravitational measure} between the object and the observer. It corresponds to the \textit{extent} of transformation, which manifests physically as gravitation potential. A value of $\kappa_Y=1$ corresponds precisely to the point where escape velocity equals the speed of light, creating an event horizon. This provides a natural causal limit for our gravitational parameter, analogous to the relative motion it determinant by the same radial normalization.

    \item \textbf{The Phase Component}\textbf{ ($\kappa_X$):} This projection governs the intrinsic scale of its proper length and proper time units, corresponding to the \textit{sequence} of its transformation.
\end{itemize}

These two components are not independent but are bound by the fundamental conservation law of the closed system, which acts as a finite ``budget of reality'':
$$
\kappa_X^2 + \kappa_Y^2 = 1
$$
The manifestation of any system is distributed between its internal (Phase) and relational (Amplitude) aspects. This single geometric constraint gives rise to the core phenomena of modern physics.
\begin{quote}
    \subsection{Gravitational Meridional Section of $S^2$}
By isotropy the omnidirectional carrier is $S^2$, but any radially symmetric
exchange reduces to a great-circle meridional section. We therefore work on a
unit great circle of $S^2$ with the parametrization
$(\kappa_X,\kappa)=(\cos\theta_2,\sin\theta_2)$.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Consequence: Gravitational Effects}

The redistribution of the budget between the Phase and Amplitude components directly produces the effects of General Relativity. An increase in the relational measure ($\kappa_Y$, gravitation potential) necessarily requires a decrease in the measure of the internal structure ($\kappa_X$). This geometric trade-off is observed physically as gravitational length and time corrections. Thus, the geometry of spacetime is nothing but the shadow cast by the geometry of relations.


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Notation simplicity:]
From here on we will write  \(\beta=\beta_X , \quad \beta_Y=\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}},\quad  \kappa=\kappa_Y , \qquad \kappa_{X} = \sqrt{1 - \kappa^{2}}\) for notation simplicity.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Gravitational Tangent Formulation}

Just as the relativistic energy--momentum relation can be expressed in terms of the kinematic projection 
$\beta = v/c$, we may construct its gravitational analogue using the potential projection $\kappa = v_{e}/c$, where $v_{e}$ is the escape velocity at radius $r$. 

In the kinematic case, with $\beta = \cos\theta_{1}$, the energy relation can be written as
\begin{equation}
    E^{2} = \bigl(\cot\theta_{1}\,E_{0}/c\bigr)^{2} + E_{0}^{2},
\end{equation}
so that the relativistic momentum is expressed as
\begin{equation}
    p = E_{0}/c\,\cot\theta_{1}.
\end{equation}

In full symmetry, the gravitational case follows from $\kappa = \sin\theta_{2}$. 
We define the gravitational energy as
\begin{equation}
    E_{g} = \frac{E_{0}}{\kappa_{X}}, 
    \qquad \kappa_{X} = \sqrt{1 - \kappa^{2}},
\end{equation}
and introduce the gravitational analogue of momentum:
\begin{equation}
    p_g \;=\; E_{0}/c\,\tan\theta_{2}.
\end{equation}

This yields the gravitational energy relation
\begin{equation}
    E_{g}^{2} = p_g^{2} + E_{0}^{2}.
\end{equation}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!60!black, title=Summary:]
\[
\beta = \cos\theta_{1}, 
\qquad 
\kappa = \sin\theta_{2},
\]
\[
\beta \;\longleftrightarrow\; \kappa,
\qquad
\cot\theta_{1} \;\longleftrightarrow\; \tan\theta_{2}.
\]

Kinematic momentum $p$ and gravitational momentum $p_g$ are thus dual 
projections of the same relational circle, expressed through complementary 
trigonometric forms.
\end{tcolorbox}


\subsection{Geometric composition of SR and GR factors}

On the unit kinematic circle ($S^1$) we parametrize
\[
(\beta,\beta_Y)=(\cos\theta_1,\ \sin\theta_1),
\]
so that the invariant vertical projection reads
\[
E\,\beta_Y=E_0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad 
\boxed{\,E=\dfrac{E_0}{\beta_Y}=\dfrac{E_0}{\sin\theta_1}\,},\qquad
p=E\,\beta=\dfrac{E_0\,\beta}{\beta_Y}=E_0\cot\theta_1,
\]
and therefore \(E^2=p^2+E_0^2\).

On the gravitational circle  ($S^2$) we parametrize
\[
(\kappa_X,\kappa)=(\cos\theta_2,\ \sin\theta_2),
\]
so that the invariant horizontal projection reads
\[
E_g\,\kappa_X=E_0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad 
\boxed{\,E_g=\dfrac{E_0}{\kappa_X}=\dfrac{E_0}{\cos\theta_2}\,},\qquad
p_g=E_g\,\kappa=\dfrac{E_0\,\kappa}{\kappa_X}=E_0\tan\theta_2,
\]
and therefore \(E_g^2=p_g^2+E_0^2\).

\subsection{Clear Relational Symmetry Between Kinematic and Potential Projections }

Now we can clearly see the underling symmetry between relativistic and gravitational factors that can be expressed in unified algebraic and trigonometric forms, as shown in Table 1.

 $p_g=E_0\,\kappa/\kappa_X$&$p_g=E_0 \tan(\theta_2)$\\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Unified representation of relativistic and gravitational effects.}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{The Combined Energy Parameter $Q$}

The total energy projection parameter unifies both aspects:

\begin{align}
    Q &=\sqrt{\kappa^2 + \beta^2}  \\
    Q^{2}&= 3\beta^2 = \frac{3}{2}\kappa^2 = \frac{3R_s}{2r_{d}} \\
    Q_t &= \sqrt{1-Q^2} = \sqrt{1-\kappa^2-\beta^2} = \sqrt{1-3\beta^2} = \sqrt{1-\frac{3}{2}\kappa^2} \\
    Q_r &= \frac{1}{Q_t}
\end{align}

These describe the combined effects of relativity and gravity.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary]
\textbf{The familiar SR and GR factors emerge here as projections of the same conserved resource. 
Relativistic ($\beta$) and gravitational ($\kappa$) modes are not separate “effects” but dual aspects of one energy-transformation constraint revealing their unified origin.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Equivalence Principle as Derived Identity}

In General Relativity the Einstein Equivalence Principle is introduced as an 
independent postulate: $m_g \equiv m_i$.  
Within WILL, no such axiom is required:

On the kinematic circle the vertical leg equals $\beta_Y=\sin\theta_1$; keeping the
same invariant $E_0$ on that leg forces a stretch $E/E_0=1/\beta_Y$.
On the gravitational circle the horizontal leg equals $\kappa_X=\cos\theta_2$;
keeping the same invariant $E_0$ on that leg forces a stretch $E_g/E_0=1/\kappa_X$.
Composing the two independent stretches gives
\[
\boxed{\;E_{\rm loc}=\frac{E_0}{\beta_Y}\times\frac{1}{\kappa_X}
=\frac{E_0}{\beta_Y\,\kappa_X}\;}
=\frac{E_0}{\sqrt{(1-\beta^2)(1-\kappa^2)}}.
\]

The inertial and gravitational projections share the same operational scale,
\[
\tilde p = E_{\rm loc}\,\beta, \qquad 
\tilde p_g = E_{\rm loc}\,\kappa,
\]
both governed by the identical stretch factor
\[
m_{\rm eff}=\frac{E_0}{\beta_Y\,\kappa_X}.
\]
Hence
\[
\boxed{\, m_g \;\equiv\; m_i \,=\, m_{\rm eff}\,},
\]

Thus, in WILL relational geometry the equality $m_g \equiv m_i$ 
is not assumed but forced by structure. 

\begin{remark}[On Eötvös-type precision]
In GR, the equality $m_g=m_i$ is imposed, while distinct relativistic factors 
later rescale energy and time. In WILL, there is no independent $m$ at all: 
the only invariant is $E_0$, and the effective response is the universal 
stretch factor $1/(\beta_Y\kappa_X)$. Since this factor depends solely on 
geometry and not on the composition of the test body, 
the universality of free fall (Eötvös experiments) follows identically. 
What GR postulates, WILL reproduces as structural necessity.
\end{remark}

\subsection*{Composition-Independence, and Quantum Interface}

\paragraph{Composition-Independence (Eötvös-type).}
Let the rest invariant decompose into internal channels
\[
E_0=\sum_{a} E_0^{(a)}\quad\text{(rest mass, binding, EM, nuclear, vacuum bookkeeping, etc.)}.
\]
WILL couples \emph{only} through the universal geometric stretch:
\[
E_{\rm loc}=\frac{1}{\beta_Y\,\kappa_X}\sum_a E_0^{(a)} \;=\; \sum_a \frac{E_0^{(a)}}{\beta_Y\,\kappa_X}.
\]
Hence each channel is multiplied by the \emph{same} factor $1/(\beta_Y\kappa_X)$, and any ratio of channel weights cancels in observables governed by the common scale. 
Therefore the operational response is composition–independent \emph{by construction}, matching the universality tested in Eötvös-type experiments, without a separate postulate $m_g=m_i$.

\paragraph{Quantum Interface (phase bookkeeping).}
In WILL the phase increment is purely relational and inherits the same scale:
\[
\Delta\phi \;\propto\; E_{\rm loc}\,\Delta\lambda
\qquad(\text{no absolute time; }\Delta\lambda\text{ is the internal ordering parameter}).
\]
Thus
\[
p=\nabla_\xi \phi \;\propto\; E_{\rm loc}\,\beta, 
\qquad 
p_g=\nabla_\chi \phi \;\propto\; E_{\rm loc}\,\kappa,
\]
so matter-wave phases and redshifts share the \emph{identical} stretch $1/(\beta_Y\kappa_X)$ across all internal channels, again yielding composition–independent interferometric outcomes.

\paragraph{Contrast with GR.}
GR recovers universality by \emph{geodesic motion in a metric} after positing $m_g\equiv m_i$.
WILL has no independent mass primitive and no external background: the same projection identity that generates 
\[
E=\frac{E_0}{\beta_Y},\quad E_g=\frac{E_0}{\kappa_X}
\]
forces the unified operational scale $E_{\rm loc}$; hence the equality of inertial and gravitational responses is an \emph{algebraic identity} of relational geometry, not an axiom. 
GR’s geodesics are a \emph{representation}; WILL’s equivalence is a \emph{consequence}.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary:]
\textbf{What GR posits as a postulate, WILL delivers as an unavoidable consequence of Relational Geometry.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Unification of Projections: The Geometric Exchange Rate}

Having established that directional (kinematic) and omnidirectional (gravitational) relations are carried by the unique manifolds $S^1$ and $S^2$ respectively, we now derive the relationship that unifies them.

\subsection{Derivation of the Energetic Closure Condition}

The Principle of a unified relational resource (Energy) requires a self-consistent "exchange rate" between its different modes of expression. This rate is not an arbitrary parameter but is dictated by the intrinsic geometry of the relations themselves:

\paragraph{1. The Ratio of Relational Degrees of Freedom.}
The most fundamental distinction between the two relational modes is their dimensionality. An omnidirectional relation ($S^2$) requires two degrees of freedom (2D) to specify a direction from its center, while a directional relation ($S^1$) requires only one (1D). The intrinsic ratio between these modes of resource distribution is therefore:
\[
\frac{\text{Omnidirectional Degrees of Freedom}}{\text{Directional Degrees of Freedom}} = \frac{2\text{D}}{1\text{D}} = 2
\]
This intuitive ratio finds its formal mathematical realization in the topology of the unique geometric carriers, expressed as the ratio of their total solid angles:
\[
\frac{\text{Total Closure of } S^2}{\text{Total Closure of } S^1} = \frac{4\pi}{2\pi} = 2
\]

\paragraph{2. The Quadratic Nature of Energetic Realization.}
To translate this dimensionless geometric ratio into a physical law, we must recognize that energy is fundamentally quadratic in nature. The energetic significance of a state is proportional not to the amplitude of a projection ($\beta$, $\kappa$), but to its \textbf{square} ($\beta^2$, $\kappa^2$). This principle is ubiquitous, reflected in kinetic energy ($E_k \propto v^2$) and in the Pythagorean (sum-of-squares) structure of the relational manifolds themselves.

\begin{definition}[Closure defect]
\(\delta \equiv \kappa^2-2\beta^2\). A subsystem is \emph{energetically closed}
iff \(\langle \delta \rangle_{cycle}=0\). For circular orbits, \(\delta\equiv 0\).
\end{definition}
\begin{proposition}[Energetic closure criterion]
In closed (momentary or periodic) regimes, the unique quadratic balance compatible
with directional ($S^1$) vs omnidirectional ($S^2$) resource splitting is
\(\boxed{\kappa^2=2\beta^2}\).
\end{proposition}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=The Principle as a Diagnostic Invariant]
The relation $\boxed{\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2}$ holds if the system under study is energetically closed momentarily (circular orbits) or periodically (elliptical orbits).  In open systems It can be used for determining the magnitude of energy flow through an unaccounted-for channels. When all the channels is included in the balance, the closure is restored and the equality holds again (see section "Numerical Validations" subsection "Earth--Moon").
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph{Conclusion: The Unification Equation.}
Therefore, the exchange rate between the energetic significance of the gravitational and kinematic modes must equal the fundamental ratio of their relational dimensions. This leads to the unique and necessary unification equation:
\[
\frac{\kappa^2}{\beta^2} = 2 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \boxed{\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2}
\]
This relation is not merely a proportionality but the precise criterion for the \textbf{energetic closure} of a system. It serves as the direct geometric embodiment of the virial theorem within the WILL framework, linking the potential and kinetic aspects of a closed system through a fundamental constant derived from pure geometry.

\subsection*{Illustrative Examples}

To clarify the meaning of this closure condition, consider two contrasting cases:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Circular Orbit (Closed Subsystem).}  
    For a test body in a perfectly circular orbit around a central mass, the condition $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$ is exactly fulfilled. The orbital system can be treated as energetically closed: all of the conserved resource is accounted for between the kinetic projection along the orbit and the gravitational projection toward the center. No external channels are needed, and the equality signals full closure.

    \item \textbf{Radiating Binary (Open Subsystem).}  
    In contrast, for a highly elliptical binary system of compact objects (such as neutron stars. (full calculation in section: Empirical Validation; subsection: Orbital Decay: Binary Pulsar)), the orbital energy is accompanied by gravitational-wave emission. If one considers only the orbital mechanics, the periodic  (elliptical orbit)  relation $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$ will be violated revealing the magnitude of energy flow through an unaccounted-for channels. When all the channels is included in the balance, the closure is restored and the equality holds again.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The foundational Principle defines the universe as a closed, conservative, symmetric relational structure $\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY}$.
    \item The relational geometry dictates that the \textit{only} closed, maximally symmetric arenas for these relations are \(S^1\) and \(S^2\), respectively.
    \item Therefore, the projection parameters $\beta=\cos\theta_1$ and  $\kappa=\sin\theta_2$ are \textit{forced} to live on these \textbf{relational} manifolds.
    \item The exchange rate between these modes is dictated by the ratio of their relational degrees of freedom (2D/1D), a principle formally realized in the topology of the manifolds as the ratio of their total solid angles ($4\pi/2\pi = 2$).
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\paragraph{Physical Implication: The Geometric Origin of Physical Law.}
This unification of projections reveals that the relationship between gravitational potential and kinetic energy is not an incidental feature of dynamics, but a direct consequence of the underlying relational geometry. Classical physics, in its successful predictions, unknowingly traces this deeper law. The identity \textbf{SPACETIME $\equiv$ ENERGY} is thus explicitly resolved as a precise geometric equivalence:
\[
\boxed{\text{Geometric Distribution (}\kappa^{2}\text{)} \;\equiv\; \text{Kinetic Distribution (}\beta^{2}\text{)}\;\times\;2}
\]

\section{Energy–Symmetry Law}\label{sec:energy-symmetry}

\subsection{Causal Continuity and Energy Symmetry}
\begin{theorem}[Energy Symmetry]
The specific energy differences (per unit of rest energy) perceived by two observers for a transition between their states balance according to the Energy–Symmetry Law:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Consider two observers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Observer $A$ at rest on the surface at radius $r_A$ (state defined by $\kappa_A, \beta_A=0$).
\item Observer $B$ orbiting at radius $r_B > r_A$ with orbital velocity $v_B$ (state defined by $\kappa_B, \beta_B$).
\end{itemize}
Each observer perceives energy transfers as the sum of the change in potential and kinetic energy budgets.

From $A$'s perspective (transition from surface to orbit):
\begin{enumerate}
\item An object gains potential energy by moving away from the gravitational center.
\item It gains kinetic energy by accelerating to orbital velocity.
\end{enumerate}
The total specific energy required for this transition is the sum of these two contributions:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\Delta E_{A \to B} = \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}\left(\kappa_A^2 - \kappa_B^2\right)}_{\text{Change in Potential}} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}\left(\beta_B^2 - \beta_A^2\right)}_{\text{Change in Kinetic}}}
\end{equation}
Since observer A is at rest, $\beta_A = 0$, and the expression simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} = \frac{1}{2}\left((\kappa_A^2 - \kappa_B^2) + \beta_B^2\right)
\end{equation}

From $B$'s perspective (transition from orbit to surface):
\begin{enumerate}
\item The object loses potential energy descending into a stronger gravitational field.
\item It loses kinetic energy by reducing its velocity to rest.
\end{enumerate}
This results in a specific energy difference:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{B \to A} = \frac{1}{2}\left((\kappa_B^2 - \kappa_A^2) + (\beta_A^2 - \beta_B^2)\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left((\kappa_B^2 - \kappa_A^2) - \beta_B^2\right)
\end{equation}

Summing these transfers gives:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0
\end{equation}
Thus, no net energy is created or destroyed in a closed cycle of transitions, confirming the Energy–Symmetry Law as a direct consequence of the geometry.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The Relational State Budget ($Q^2$) vs. Energy Transfer ($\Delta E$)}

It is crucial to distinguish between two related but distinct concepts:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Quadratic State Budget ($Q^2$):} This dimensionless quantity describes the total geometric "footprint" of an object's state, combining its potential and kinetic aspects. It is defined as the sum of the squares of the projections:
    \begin{equation}
    Q^2 = \kappa^2 + \beta^2
    \end{equation}
    The change in this value, $\Delta(Q^2) = Q_B^2 - Q_A^2$, represents the net change in the geometric descriptor of the state, but \textbf{it is not the energy transfer}. As demonstrated by the GPS satellite example, $\frac{1}{2}\Delta(Q^2)$ corresponds to the \textit{difference} between the change in potential energy and the change in kinetic energy.

    \item \textbf{The Specific Energy Transfer ($\Delta E$):} This is the physical quantity representing the actual work done and change in motion, corresponding to the classical total energy of a transition (per unit rest energy). It is defined as the \textbf{sum of the changes} in the potential and kinetic energy budgets:
    \begin{equation}
    \Delta E_{A \to B} = \Delta U_{A \to B} + \Delta K_{A \to B} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\kappa_A^2 - \kappa_B^2\right) + \frac{1}{2}\left(\beta_B^2 - \beta_A^2\right)
    \end{equation}
    It is this quantity, $\Delta E$, that is conserved and must balance to zero in any closed cycle.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Physical Meaning of the Factor $\frac{1}{2}$}

The factor $\frac{1}{2}$ does not originate from classical mechanics but from the fundamental quadratic nature of the energy budgets in WILL geometry.

The energetic significance of a state is proportional to the \textbf{square} of its geometric projection. This is analogous to how kinetic energy is proportional to velocity squared ($v^2$) or how the energy in a wave is proportional to its amplitude squared ($A^2$). The individual energy budgets are defined as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Specific Potential Energy Budget:} $U/E_0 \propto -\frac{1}{2}\kappa^2$
    \item \textbf{Specific Kinetic Energy Budget:} $K/E_0 = \frac{1}{2}\beta^2$
\end{itemize}
The factor $\frac{1}{2}$ arises naturally when representing a conserved quantity (energy) through a quadratic measure (the square of a projection). The Energy-Symmetry Law deals with the sum of the \textit{changes} in these individual budgets.

\subsection{Universal Speed Limit as a Consequence of Energy Symmetry}
\begin{theorem}[Universal Speed Limit]
The universal speed limit ($v \leq c$) emerges naturally from the requirement of energetic symmetry.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Assume an object could exceed the speed of light, implying $\beta > 1$. In this scenario, its specific kinetic energy budget, $\frac{1}{2}\beta^2$, would become arbitrarily large.

The energy transfer required to reach this state, $\Delta E_{A \to B}$, would also become arbitrarily large. Consequently, no finite physical process could provide a balancing reverse transfer, $\Delta E_{B \to A}$, that would sum to zero. The fundamental symmetry would be broken:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} \neq 0
\end{equation}
Therefore, the condition $\beta \leq 1$ (which implies $v \leq c$) is an intrinsic requirement for maintaining the causal and energetic consistency of the relational universe.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Transparent Energy Balance for Closed Orbits}

When the closure condition for stable, periodic orbits ($\kappa^2 - 2\beta^2 = 0$) is applied, the general Energy-Symmetry Law simplifies into remarkably elegant and direct forms. These simplified equations provide the precise energy balance for transitions involving energetically closed systems, such as planets or satellites in stable orbits.

\paragraph{Case 1: Surface-to-Orbit Transfer.}
For a transfer from a state of rest (A, where $\beta_A = 0$) to a closed orbit (B) where $E_{0B}$ is the objects rest energy, the specific energy balance is given by:
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{A \to B}}{E_{0B}} = \frac{1}{2}(\kappa_A^2 - \beta_B^2)
\end{equation}
This result is derived by applying the closure condition $\kappa_B^2 = 2\beta_B^2$ to the general energy transfer formula, elegantly linking the initial potential projection to the final kinetic projection.

\paragraph{Case 2: Orbit-to-Orbit Transfer.}
For a transfer between two different closed orbits (A and B), the simplification is even more profound. The specific energy balance reduces to:
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{A \to B}}{E_{0B}} = \frac{1}{2}(\beta_A^2 - \beta_B^2)
\end{equation}
In this case, applying the closure condition to both the initial and final orbits causes the potential projection terms ($\kappa^2$) to cancel out completely. The entire energy balance of the transfer is expressed purely as the difference between the squares of the initial and final kinetic projections. This demonstrates a deep symmetry in the energetic structure of stable orbital systems.


\subsection{Single–Axis Energy Transfer and the Nature of Light}
\begin{theorem}[Single–Axis Transformation Principle]
For light, the kinematic projection reaches its full extent:
\[
\boxed{\beta = 1 \;\Rightarrow\; \beta_Y = 0.}
\]
This means that all transformation of the relational energy occurs along a \textbf{single orthogonal axis}.
The complementary branch of the bidirectional energy exchange is absent, and the total resource of transformation is entirely expressed on one geometric component.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
For massive systems, the Energy–Symmetry Law distributes the total energy exchange evenly between two orthogonal projections:
\[
U/E_0 = -\tfrac{1}{2}\kappa^2, \qquad
K/E_0 = +\tfrac{1}{2}\beta^2.
\]
The symmetry of exchange arises because both branches --- $(\kappa, \kappa_X)$ and $(\beta, \beta_Y)$ --- coexist and compensate each other.
Each side carries one half of the total transformation resource, ensuring
\[
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0.
\]

For light, however, $\beta = 1$ implies $\beta_Y = 0$.
The complementary projection disappears; there is no dual observer-frame available for symmetric partition.
As a result, the transformation cannot be divided between two orthogonal branches.
The full relational resource of the interaction is realized on a single projection.

Therefore, the specific energy potential for light is not halved but complete:
\[
\boxed{\Phi_\gamma = \kappa^2 c^2,}
\]
while for a massive body the potential remains partitioned,
\[
\Phi_{\text{mass}} = \tfrac{1}{2}\kappa^2 c^2.
\]
This explains why light experiences a total geometric effect exactly twice that of a massive particle in the same field, without introducing any auxiliary approximations.
\end{proof}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!80!black,title=Interpretive Note]
Light occupies the boundary state where relational reciprocity collapses into self-reference.
It is not a “massless limit” but a distinct single-axis state of the energy geometry.
A photon is simultaneously its own counter-frame and its own anti-state.
The factor of two that appears in gravitational deflection and frequency shift is a direct signature of this one-axis transformation.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary]
\textbf{ Light has no rest frame.

\textbf{Causality} is not an external rule but a \textbf{built-in feature of Relational Geometry}.

\section{Classical Keplerian Energy as a WILL--Minkowski Projection}

A striking consequence of the Energy--Symmetry Law is that, when the
zero of gravitational potential is chosen on the surface of the central body
rather than at infinity, the total specific orbital energy (potential $+$ kinetic,
per unit mass) naturally appears in \emph{Minkowski form}.

\subsection{Classical Result with Surface Reference}

For a test body of mass $m$ on a circular orbit of radius $a$ about
a central mass $M_\oplus$ (Earth in our example),
classical Newtonian mechanics gives:
\begin{align}
\Delta U &= -\frac{GM_\oplus m}{a} + \frac{GM_\oplus m}{R_\oplus},\\
K &= \frac12 m\frac{GM_\oplus}{a}.
\end{align}
Adding these and dividing by the rest--energy $E_0 = m c^2$ yields
the dimensionless total:
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{\text{tot}}}{E_0}
= \frac{GM_\oplus}{R_\oplus c^2}
 - \frac12\frac{GM_\oplus}{a c^2}.
\label{eq:classical_surface}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Projection Parameters and Minkowski-like Form}

Define the WILL projection parameters for the surface and the orbit:
\begin{align}
\kappa_\oplus^2 &\equiv \frac{2GM_\oplus}{R_\oplus c^2},\\
\beta_{\text{orbit}}^2 &\equiv \frac{GM_\oplus}{a c^2}.
\end{align}
Substituting into \eqref{eq:classical_surface} gives the exact identity:
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{\text{tot}}}{E_0}
= \frac12\bigl(\kappa_\oplus^2 - \beta_{\text{orbit}}^2\bigr).
\label{eq:will_minkowski_energy}
\end{equation}

This is already in the form of a \emph{hyperbolic difference of squares}:
if we set $x \equiv \kappa_\oplus$ and $y \equiv \beta_{\text{orbit}}$, then
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{\text{tot}}}{E_0} = \frac12\,(x^2 - y^2),
\end{equation}
which is structurally identical to a Minkowski interval in $(1+1)$ dimensions,
up to the constant factor $\frac12$.

\paragraph{Sign convention.}
We use $U/E_0= -\tfrac12\,\kappa^2$ and $K/E_0=\tfrac12\,\beta^2$ as \emph{budgets}.
The minus sign attaches to the potential budget by convention of reference (surface vs infinity);
the budgets themselves are positive quadratic measures, while transfer $\Delta E$ is the signed sum
of budget \emph{changes}.

\subsection{Physical Interpretation}

In classical derivations, \eqref{eq:classical_surface} is just the sum
$\Delta U + K$ with a particular choice of potential zero.
In the WILL framework, \eqref{eq:will_minkowski_energy} emerges directly from the
energy--symmetry relation:
\[
\Delta E_{A\to B}
= \frac12\bigl((\kappa_A^2 - \kappa_B^2) + \beta_B^2\bigr),
\]
with $(A,B) = (\text{surface},\ \text{orbit})$,
and is \emph{invariantly} expressible as a difference of squared projections.

This shows that the Keplerian total energy is not an isolated Newtonian
artifact but a special case of a deeper geometric structure. 
While this framework refuse to postulate any spacetime metric in the traditional sense, the emergence of this Minkowski-like structure from purely energetic principles is a powerful indicator of the deep identity between the geometry of spacetime and the geometry of energy transformation. 

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Why This Matters]
\begin{itemize}
\item In classical form, the total orbital energy per unit mass depends only on
$GM$ and $a$, and is independent of the test--mass $m$.
\item In WILL form, the same fact is embedded in a Minkowski--like difference
of squared projections, with no need for separate ``gravitational'' and
``kinetic'' constructs.
\item This reframing answers \emph{why} the Keplerian combination appears:
it is enforced by the underlying geometry of energy transformation.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}


\section{Lagrangian and Hamiltonian as Ontologically Corrupted WILL Approximations}
\textit{The following section present philosophical and algebraic 
demonstration: the standard $L$ and $H$ arise as degenerate limits of the relational 
Energy–Symmetry law.}

We now demonstrate that the familiar Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms 
are not fundamental principles but ontologically ``dirty'' approximations of 
the relational WILL framework. By collapsing the two-point relational structure 
into a single-point description, classical mechanics gains computational convenience 
at the cost of ontological clarity.

\subsection{Definitions of Parameters}

We consider a central mass $M$ and a test mass $m$. The state of the test 
mass is described in polar coordinates $(r,\phi)$ relative to the central 
mass.

\begin{itemize}
  \item $r_A$ --- reference radius associated with observer $A$ 
  (e.g., planetary surface).
  \item $r_B$ --- orbital radius of the test mass $m$ (position of observer $B$).
  \item $v_B^2 = \dot r_B^2 + r_B^2 \dot\phi^2$ --- total squared orbital speed at $B$.
  \item $\beta_B^2 = v_B^2/c^2$ --- dimensionless kinematic projection at $B$.
  \item $\kappa_A^2 = 2GM/(r_A c^2)$ --- dimensionless potential projection defined at $A$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Relational Lagrangian}

Instead of a relational energy, we define the \emph{clean relational Lagrangian} $L_{\text{rel}}$, which represents the kinetic budget at point $B$ relative to the potential budget at point $A$:
\begin{equation}
L_{\text{rel}} = T(B) - U(A) = \tfrac{1}{2} m\left(\dot r_B^2 + r_B^2 \dot\phi^2\right) - \frac{GMm}{r_A}.
\end{equation}
In dimensionless form, using the rest energy $E_0 = mc^2$, this is:
\begin{equation}
\frac{L_{\text{rel}}}{E_0} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(\beta_B^2 + \kappa_A^2\bigr).
\end{equation}
This two-point, relational form is the clean geometric statement.

\subsection{First Ontological Collapse: The Newtonian Lagrangian}

If one commits the first ontological violation by identifying the two 
distinct points, $r_A = r_B = r$, the relational structure degenerates into a 
local, single-point function:
\begin{equation}
L(r,\dot r,\dot\phi)=\tfrac12 m(\dot r^2+r^2\dot\phi^2)+\frac{GMm}{r}.
\end{equation}
This is precisely the standard Newtonian Lagrangian. Its origin is not fundamental 
but arises from the collapse of the two-point relational Energy Symmetry law into 
a one-point formalism.

\subsection{Second Ontological Collapse: The Hamiltonian}

Introducing canonical momenta,
\begin{align}
p_r &= \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot r} = m\dot r, \\
p_\phi &= \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot\phi} = mr^2\dot\phi,
\end{align}
one defines the Hamiltonian via the Legendre transformation $H = p_r \dot r + p_\phi \dot\phi - L$. This evaluates to the total energy of the collapsed system:
\begin{equation}
H = T+U = \tfrac{1}{2} m\left(\dot r^2 + r^2 \dot\phi^2\right) + \frac{GMm}{r}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Interpretation}

In terms of the collapsed WILL projections ($\beta^2 = v^2/c^2$ and $\kappa^2 = 2GM/(rc^2)$, both strictly positive), the match to standard mechanics becomes explicit:
\begin{align}
L &= \tfrac{1}{2} m v^2 + \frac{GMm}{r}
   \;\;\;\longleftrightarrow\;\;\;
   \tfrac{1}{2} m c^2\bigl(\beta^2 + \kappa^2\bigr), \\[6pt]
H &= \tfrac{1}{2} m v^2 - \frac{GMm}{r}
   \;\;\;\longleftrightarrow\;\;\;
   \tfrac{1}{2} m c^2\bigl(\beta^2 - \kappa^2\bigr).
\end{align}

Here the ``$+$'' or ``$-$'' signs do not come from $\kappa^2$ itself, which is always positive, but from the ontological collapse of the two-point relational energy law into a single-point formalism. In WILL, both projections are clean and positive; in standard mechanics, the apparent sign difference arises only after this collapse.

Both are ontologically ``dirty''  approximations. The clean relational law, 
involving distinct points $A$ and $B$, is collapsed into a local, 
one-point description. This shows that  Hamiltonian and  Lagrangian are just needlessly overcomplicated approximations that  lose in ontological integrity.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Key Message]
The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian are not fundamental principles. They are 
degenerate shadows of a deeper relational Energy Symmetry law. Classical mechanics, 
Special Relativity, and General Relativity all operate within this corrupted 
approximation. WILL restores the underlying two-point relational clarity.
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Legacy Dictionary (for conventional formalisms).}  

Within WILL Geometry, all physical content is expressed purely in terms of relational projections $\beta$ and $\kappa$ on $S^1$ and $S^2$.

2. \emph{Canonical mechanics (Lagrangian/Hamiltonian):}

They arise only after collapsing the two-point relational law into a one-point formalism.  
They are computational \emph{shadows}, useful for legacy calculations but physically redundant.

\section{Derivation of Density, Mass, and Pressure}

\subsection{Geometric Foundation}
From the projective analysis established in the previous sections, the fundamental invariant is
\[
\kappa^2 = \frac{R_s}{r_d},
\]
where $\kappa$ emerges from the energy projection on the area of unit sphere $S^2$, and $R_s = 2Gm_0/c^2$ links to the mass scale factor $m_0 = E_0/c^2$.

\subsection{Derivation of Energy Density}

\paragraph{From Mass Scale to Volumetric Potential.}
Starting from the geometric relation,
\[
m_0 = \frac{\kappa^2 c^2 r_d}{2G},
\]
we associate $m_0$ with a volumetric proxy $r_d^3$, obtaining a raw volumetric potential,
\[
\frac{m_0}{r_d^3} = \frac{\kappa^2 c^2}{2G r_d^2}.
\]

\paragraph{Applying the Geometric Distribution Principle.}
Because the potential projection $\kappa$ is distributed over S2  -  a 2D spherical manifold, the volumetric expression must be normalized over the unit-sphere area $4\pi$. This yields the physical energy density,
\[
\rho = \frac{1}{4\pi}\left(\frac{\kappa^2 c^2}{2G r_d^2}\right) 
.
\]
\[
\rho = \frac{\kappa^2c^2}{8\pi G r_d^2}.
\]
$$\text{Local Energy Density} \equiv \text{Relational Projection}$$

\paragraph{Maximal Density.}
At $\kappa^2 = R_s/r_d = 1$, the horizon condition is reached, corresponding to the maximal observable energy density at radius $r_d=R_s$:
\[
\rho_{\max} = \frac{c^2}{8\pi G r_d^2}.
\]
\paragraph{Normalized Relation.}
Thus the fundamental identification is
\[
\boxed{\;\kappa^2 = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{\max}} \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; \kappa^2 \equiv \Omega\;}.
\]

\subsection{Self-Consistency Requirement}

The mass scale factor can be expressed in two equivalent ways.

From the geometric definition:
\[
m_0 = \frac{\kappa^2 c^2 r_d}{2G}.
\]

From the energy density:
\[
m_0 = \alpha \, r_d^n \, \rho.
\]

Substituting $\rho = \frac{\kappa^2 c^2}{8\pi G r_{d}^2}$ into $m_0 = \alpha \, r_d^n \, \rho$ gives
\[
m_0 = \frac{\alpha \kappa^2 c^2 r_d^{n-2}}{8\pi G}.
\]

Equating the two forms:
\[
\frac{\alpha r_d^{n-2}}{8\pi} = \frac{r_d}{2}.
\]

Radius independence requires $n=3$, yielding $\alpha=4\pi$. Hence,
\[
m_0 = 4\pi r_d^3 \rho,
\]
which closes the consistency loop between the geometric and density-based formulations.

\subsection{Pressure as Surface Curvature Gradient}

In the WILL framework pressure is not a thermodynamic assumption but the direct consequence of curvature gradients.  
The radial balance relation gives
\[
P(r) \;=\; \frac{c^4}{8\pi G}\,\frac{1}{r}\,\frac{d\kappa^2}{dr}.
\]

Using $\kappa^2 = R_s/r$, one finds $d\kappa^2/dr = -\kappa^2/r$, hence
\[
P(r) \;=\; -\,\frac{\kappa^2 c^4}{8\pi G r^2}.
\]

Since the local energy density is
\[
\rho(r) \;=\; \frac{\kappa^2 c^2}{8\pi G r^2},
\]
this yields the invariant equation of state
\[
\boxed{\,P(r) = -\,\rho(r)\,c^2\,}.
\]

\paragraph{Interpretation.}
$P$ is a surface-like negative pressure (isotropic tension), not a bulk volume pressure.  
It expresses the resistance of energy–geometry itself to changes in projection.  

\paragraph{Consistency.}
If one formally freezes the projection parameter ($d\kappa^2/dr=0$), then $P=0$.  
But in this case the angular curvature terms remain uncompensated, and the field equation is no longer satisfied.  
Any nontrivial radial dependence of $\kappa$ inevitably generates the negative tension 
\[
P = -\rho c^2,
\]
which precisely cancels the residual curvature.  
Thus the negative pressure is not optional but a necessary ingredient for full self-consistency.

\paragraph{Maximum pressure.}
At the geometric bound $\kappa^2=1$ (horizon condition), the density saturates at
\[
\rho_{\max} = \frac{c^2}{8\pi G r^2},
\]
and the corresponding pressure is
\[
P_{\max} = -\,\rho_{\max}\,c^2 \;=\; -\,\frac{c^4}{8\pi G r^2}.
\]
This negative surface pressure represents the ultimate tension limit of spacetime fabric at a given scale $r$.


Pressure in WILL is the intrinsic surface tension of energy–geometry, saturating at $P_{\max}=-c^4/(8\pi G r^2)$.


\section{Rotational Systems (Kerr Without Metric)}

\subsection{Contextual Bounds}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{For a gravitationally closed (static) system,} the physical boundary is defined by the condition $\kappa^2 = 1$. The closure principle ($\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$) is what dictates that this corresponds to a kinetic state of $\beta^2 = 1/2$.
    \item \textbf{For a kinematically closed (maximally rotating) system,} the physical boundary is defined by the condition $\beta^2 = 1$. The same closure principle ($\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$) then necessitates that the corresponding gravitational state must be $\kappa^2 = 2$.
\end{itemize}

For rotating black holes, we establish the connection between relational kinetic projection and the Kerr metric by defining:

\[
\beta =\frac{a c^2}{G m_0}, \quad \kappa = \sqrt{2} \beta
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\beta\) is the relational rotation parameter, with \(0 \leq \beta \leq 1\),
    \item \(\kappa\) is related to the geometry and gravity,
    \item \(R_s = \frac{2 G m_0}{c^2}\) is the Schwarzschild radius,
    \item \(a = \frac{J}{m_0 c}\) is the Kerr rotation parameter,
    \item \(J\) is the angular momentum of the black hole,
    \item \(m_0\) is the mass of the black hole.
\end{itemize}

We also derive a key invariant relationship:

\[
a_{\max} = \frac{G m_0}{c^2} = \frac{R_s}{2} =\beta_{\max}^2  r_{d}
\]

This relationship holds when \(r_{d} = \frac{R_s}{2 \beta^2}\), providing an elegant connection between the parameters.

\subsection{Event Horizon}
Using our approach, the inner and outer event horizons of the Kerr metric are expressed as:

\[
r_{\pm} = \frac{R_s}{2} \left(1 \pm {\beta_Y}\right)
\]

For the extreme case where \(\beta = 1\) (maximal rotation), the horizons merge at:

\[
r_{+} = r_{-} = \frac{R_s}{2}
\]

This coincides with the minimum radius in our model predicted using maximum value of $\kappa$ parameter $\kappa_{max}=\sqrt{2}$:

\[
r_{\min} = \frac{1}{\kappa_{max}^2} R_s = \frac{1}{2} R_s
\]

\subsection{Ergosphere}
The radius of the ergosphere in our model is described as:

\[
r_{\text{ergo}} = \frac{R_s}{2} \left(1 + \sqrt{1 - \beta^2 \cos^2 \theta}\right)
\]

This formulation correctly reproduces the key features of the ergosphere:
\begin{itemize}
    \item At the equator (\(\theta = \pi / 2\)), \(r_{\text{ergo}} = R_s\) for any rotation parameter,
    \item At the poles (\(\theta = 0\)), \(r_{\text{ergo}}\) coincides with the event horizon radius.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ring Singularity}
Unlike the Schwarzschild metric with its point singularity, the Kerr metric features a ring singularity located at:
\[
r = 0, \quad \theta = \frac{\pi}{2}
\]
The "size" of this ring is proportional to \(a = \frac{G m_0}{c^2} \beta\), reaching its maximum for extreme black holes (\(\beta = 1\)).

\subsection{Naked Singularity}
For \(\beta \leq 1\), a naked singularity does not emerge, aligning with the cosmic censorship Principle. In our model, Energy Symmetry Law enforce constraint by limiting \(\beta\) to the range \([0, 1]\).

\subsection{The Relationship Between \(\kappa > 1\) and Rotation}
For extreme rotation (\(\beta = 1\)), we find \(\kappa = \sqrt{2} > 1\), which reflects the displacement of the event horizon and the geometric properties of rotating black holes. This suggests that values of \(\kappa > 1\) are inherently connected to the physics of rotation in spacetime.

This connection suggests that the rotation of a black hole can be understood through geometric parameters analogous to orbital mechanics. Physically, it indicates that the rotational properties of the black hole, encapsulated in \(a_*\), mirror the orbital velocity parameter \(\beta\), providing a unified description of spacetime dynamics.

\textbf{Philosophically}, this reinforces the notion that gravitational phenomena, including rotation, are manifestations of the underlying geometry of the universe. The absence of additional "material" parameters underscores the elegance of general relativity, where the curvature of spacetime alone dictates the behavior of massive rotating objects. This geometric interpretation bridges the gap between the abstract mathematics of the Kerr metric and the intuitive physics of orbital motion, offering a deeper insight into the nature of spacetime.

\subsection*{Physical Interpretation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{No need for pre-existing spacetime} — geometry emerges from angular energy distributions.
  \item \textbf{All parameters} are dimensionless and directly derived from the speed of light as finite resource.
  \item \textbf{Scale invariance:} The same structure applies from Planck-scale objects to galactic black holes.
\end{itemize}


\section{Unified Geometric Field Equation}

\subsection{The Theoretical Uroboros}
From the energy-geometry equivalence, the complete description of gravitational phenomena reduces to a single algebraic relation:

\begin{equation}
\boxed{
\kappa^2 = \frac{R_s}{r_{d}} = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{max}}
}
\label{eq:unified_field}
\end{equation}
                                        \textbf{The ratio of geometric scales equals the ratio of energy densities.}\\

This is the unified geometric field equation of WILL Geometry. It expresses the complete equivalence:
\[
\text{SPACETIME GEOMETRY} \equiv \text{ENERGY DISTRIBUTION}
\]
We have shown that this single foundational Principle, through pure geometric reasoning, necessarily leads to an equation which mathematically expresses the very same equivalence we began with. We started with a single foundational  Principle \(\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY}\), from which geometry and physical laws are logically derived, and these derived laws then loop back to intrinsically define and limit the very nature of energy and spacetime, proving the self-consistency of the initial idea.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{img/Theoretical-Ouroboros-min.jpg}
The foundational  Principle \(\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY}\) closes into the unified field equation
\[
\frac{R_s}{r_d} = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{\max}},
\]
\end{figure}


\begin{quote}
Theoretical Uroboros

The WILL framework exhibits perfect logical closure: the fundamental Principle about the nature of spacetime and energy is proven as the inevitable consequence of geometric consistency.

\end{quote}

  From a philosophical and epistemological point of view, this can be considered the crown achievement of any theoretical framework — the “Theoretical Uroboros”. But regardless of  aesthetic beauty of this result let’s remain skeptical.

\subsection{No Singularities, No Hidden Regions}

This framework introduces no interior singularities, no coordinate patches hidden behind horizons, and no ambiguous initial conditions. The geometric field equation:

\[
\frac{R_{s}}{r_{d}}=\frac{8\pi G}{c^{2}}r_{d}^{2}\ \rho=\kappa^{2}
\]
ensures that curvature and energy density evolve smoothly and remain bounded across all observable scales.

WILL Geometry resolves the singularity problem not by regularizing divergent terms, nor by introducing quantum effects, but by geometrically constraining the domain of valid projections. Curvature is always finite, and energy remains bounded by construction. Black holes become energetically saturated but nonsingular regions, described entirely by finite, dimensionless parameters.

This projectional approach provides a clean, intrinsic termination to gravitational collapse, replacing singular endpoints with structured, maximally curved boundaries.

\section{Beyond Differential Formalism: Structural Dynamics}

\subsection{Intrinsic Dynamics via Energy Redistribution}


The system is not described by differential equations of motion evolving \textit{in} time. Instead, its transformation is dictated by a closed network of algebraic relations that enforce a perpetually balanced configuration. Any change in one parameter necessitates a coordinated shift in all others to maintain geometric self-consistency. What we perceive as "dynamics" is this ordered succession of balanced states. The framework thus inverts the classical paradigm: 

The foundation of WILL Geometry lies in the principle that spacetime geometry is fully determined by the distribution of energy, parameterized by the dimensionless quantities \(\beta\) and \(\kappa\). Any change in the system's energy—due to mass variation, motion, or redistribution—directly reshapes the geometry. This intrinsic linkage ensures that dynamics is embedded within the model itself, without requiring external equations of motion.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!40!black,title=This reveals a fundamental inversion of the classical paradigm:]
 \textbf{Time does not drive change — instead, change defines time.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{Why There Are No Equations of Motion}

In classical and relativistic physics, dynamics is formulated through differential equations.  
These express how physical quantities evolve continuously through time, typically governed by:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A temporal parameter $t$,
    \item A Lagrangian function $L$,
    \item A variational principle: $\delta S = 0$, where $S = \int L\,dt$,
    \item Euler–Lagrange equations that yield the system’s path.
\end{itemize}

This framework assumes:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A continuum of possible configurations,
    \item That Nature selects one by minimizing action,
    \item That time flows independently of the system.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Why This Framework Does Not Apply to WILL Geometry}

WILL Geometry begins from a fundamentally different premise.

\begin{itemize}
    \item There is no "space" of possible paths.
    \item There is no "freedom to vary."
    \item The system does not evolve through time --- it \textbf{defines time} through its structure.
\end{itemize}

In this model:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Each observable is locked in a network of algebraic relations.
    \item Any change in one parameter \textit{necessitates} coherent changes in the others.
    \item   Self-consistency enforces projectional  \textbf{balance}.
\end{itemize}

There is only one valid configuration at any moment:  
the one where all projectional constraints are satisfied.  
Everything else is not forbidden — it is undefined.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Geometric Principle of Action]
In WILL Geometry, there is no equation of motion.  
There is no Lagrangian.  
There is no variational calculus.  

There is only a closed system of geometric and energetic relationships,  
and the sequence of valid configurations is what we call \textit{dynamics}.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!40!black,title=The only necessary input:]
 \textbf{The observable sequence of transformations in the system's energy geometry is the only necessary input for describing its evolution.
.}\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Time as an Emergent Property}

In this framework, time is not a fundamental entity but a derived concept tied to changes in the system's geometry. Similar to time dilation in special relativity, time intervals here are defined by the transformations of geometric parameters like \(r_{d}\) and \(\kappa\). This eliminates the need for an external clock.

A natural time scale arises from the geometry as \(t_{d} = \frac{r_{d}}{c}\). For instance, during mass accretion onto a black hole, \(r_{d}\) adjusts as the mass changes, and \(t_{d}\) evolves accordingly. This intrinsic time scale encapsulates the system's dynamics without invoking an independent time variable.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!40!black,title=Note for readers accustomed to classical dynamics]
Unlike traditional formulations of dynamics based on an external time parameter \(t\), the WILL Geometry framework describes evolution as an intrinsic transformation of the system's geometric structure. Time is not a fundamental variable but an emergent quantity derived from energy redistribution. All physical change is encoded in the interdependence of parameters \(\beta\), \(\kappa\), and \(\rho\), etc without requiring differential equations or initial conditions.\\

This marks a fundamental shift: dynamics here is not a process unfolding "in time," but a change in relational energy geometry itself. The model does not track transformations through an imposed temporal axis — instead, it reveals that what we perceive as temporal progression is a manifestation of continuous geometric reconfiguration. \textbf{Thus, prediction becomes a question of geometric continuity, not temporal evolution.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection*{From Structure to Motion}

In the next section, we present the core structural closure of the system ---  
a set of algebraic invariants that together form the backbone of all observed dynamics.  
These relations are not definitions.  
They are the \textbf{complete geometry of change}, seen from within.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Dynamics in WILL Geometry]
Dynamics in WILL Geometry is not described by differential equations
but by the ordered succession of globally balanced, algebraically determined configurations.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Algebraic Closure and Structural Causality}

In WILL Geometry, physical dynamics emerges from a set of algebraically closed invariants.  
Each parameter participates in a self-consistent configuration of relational constraints.  
There are no functions, no dependent variables, and no variation over time --- only balanced configurations.

The following set of relations expresses the minimal algebraic closure of the WILL structure:

\[
\begin{cases}
\kappa^2 = 2 \beta^2 \\
R_s = \dfrac{2G m_0}{c^2} \\
r_{d} \cdot \kappa^2 = R_s \\
\rho = \dfrac{\kappa^2 c^2}{8\pi Gr_{d}^2} \\
H = \dfrac{c}{r_{d}} \\
\Lambda = \dfrac{\kappa^2}{r_{d}^2} \\
m_0 = 4\pi r_{d}^3 \cdot \rho
\end{cases}
\]

These are not definitions.  
They are mutual constraints --- an algebraic simultaneity.  
Changing any one parameter necessitates a coordinated shift in all others to maintain validity.

\subsection*{Causal Closure without Circularity}

The structure of WILL Geometry is causally closed but not circular.  
Each parameter is either independently observable or computable from a minimal input pair  
consisting of one dynamic projection (such as $\kappa$ or $\beta$) and one scale quantity (such as $r$, $M$, or $\rho$).

The system avoids circularity by ensuring that no parameter both defines and is defined by the same input.  
Instead, values propagate through directed dependencies rooted in physically measurable quantities.  
Multiple valid entry points exist, but all reduce to consistent, non-redundant relationships  
governed by the fundamental geometric field equation.

The result is a structure where \textbf{causality is internal}, \textbf{coherence is enforced},  
and \textbf{dynamics is simply the shifting of balanced configurations} ---  
not the unfolding of arbitrary functions over time.


\subsection{Numerical Example: Accretion onto a Black Hole}

Consider a black hole accreting mass from a surrounding disk to illustrate the model's intrinsic dynamics. Let the initial mass be $m_0 = 10 , M_\odot$, with a Schwarzschild radius $R_s = \frac{2 G m_0}{c^2} \approx 2.95 \times 10^4 , \text{m}$. Suppose $\kappa = 0.1$, so $r_{d} = \frac{R_s}{\kappa^2} = \frac{2.95 \times 10^4}{0.01} = 2.95 \times 10^6 , \text{m}$, and the associated time scale is $t_{d} = \frac{r_{d}}{c} \approx 9.83 \times 10^{-3} , \text{s}$.

As the black hole accretes mass, increasing to $m_1 = 10.1 , M_\odot$, the Schwarzschild radius becomes $R_s \approx 2.98 \times 10^4 , \text{m}$. Assuming $\kappa$ remains constant for simplicity, $r_{d} = \frac{2.98 \times 10^4}{0.01} = 2.98 \times 10^6 , \text{m}$, and $t_{d} \approx 9.93 \times 10^{-3} , \text{s}$. This increase in $t_{d}$ reflects the system's evolution, driven solely by the changing geometry.
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!40!black,title=No differential equations are required:]
 \textbf{Dynamics unfolds as a consequence of relational energy transformations.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{General Principle of Dynamics}

The overarching principle in WILL Geometry is that any physical change—be it mass accretion, gravitational collapse, or expansion—manifests as a transformation in the geometric structure. The parameters \(\beta\), \(\kappa\), and \(r_{d}\) adjust self-consistently, ensuring that the system's evolution is fully described within the model. This approach eliminates the need for differential equations of motion or external initial conditions, as the geometry at any given "moment" is determined by the current energy configuration.

Thus, the temporal sequence we observe is simply the ordered unfolding of geometric transitions:

\[
\boxed{
\text{Time} \equiv \text{Change in } (\kappa, \beta, \rho, r_{d}...)
}
\]

 This leads to a unified, self-consistent model where **geometry generates both transformations and observability**. There is no external timeline — only evolving curvature.
 
\subsection{Conclusion}

In conclusion, dynamics in WILL Geometry emerges naturally from the redistribution of energy within the system's geometric framework. Time arises as a consequence of these geometric changes, providing a unified description of spacetime and energy transformations. This intrinsic approach simplifies the treatment of dynamical processes and offers a novel perspective on the nature of physical systems.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!75!black,title=Geometric Principle of Evolution, fonttitle=\bfseries]
Physics is not the evolution of a system through time,\\
but the geometric transformation of the energy landscape,\\
where \textit{“time”} is simply the name we give to the sequence of such transitions.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{The Fundamental Invariant $W_{\text{ill}} = 1$}

From the geometric closure of WILL framework, we derive a universal dimensionless invariant:

\begin{equation}
W_{ill} = \frac{E \cdot T^2}{M \cdot L^2} = \frac{\frac{1}{\kappa_{X}} E_0 \kappa_{X} t^2_{d}}{\frac{1}{\beta_{Y}} m_0\beta_{Y} r^2_{d}} = 1
\end{equation}

\textbf{Proof:} Substituting the geometric definitions:
\begin{align}
W_{\text{ill}} &= \frac{\frac{1}{\cos \theta_2}\ m_0c^2 \cos \theta_2 \frac{r^2_{d}}{c^2}}{\frac{1}{\sin\theta_1}\ m_0 \sin\theta_1 r^2_{d}} = \frac{m_0c^2 r^2_{d}}{c^2} \cdot \frac{\sin\theta_1}{m_0 r^2_{d}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin\theta_1} = 1
\end{align}

This invariant holds universally for all values of $m_0$, $G$, $c$, and $\kappa$. Unlike dimensional analysis, this identity emerges from the projectional interdependence of energy-mass $(E,M)$ and spacetime metrics $(T,L)$ within the unified structure.

\[
\boxed{\text{The invariant } W_{\text{ill}} = 1 \text{ expresses geometric unity through energetic projection}}
\]

\subsection{The Name "WILL"}
The name WILL reflects both the harmonious unity of the equation and a subtle irony towards the anthropic principle, which often intertwines human existence with the causality of the universe. The equation stands as a testament to the universal laws of physics, transcending any anthropocentric framework.


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=WILL]
\[
\boxed{
\textbf{It is not the unit of something—it is the unity of everything.}
}
\]
\end{tcolorbox}


\[
\boxed{\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY}}
\]
All the derived relations for local energy density, pressure, enclosed mass, and horizon formation are purely logical and mathematical consequences of this unique guiding principle. In this sense, the WILL Geometry framework achieves absolute epistemological cleanliness: it does not introduce any hidden assumptions or coordinate structures. The entire gravitational and relativistic sector (as reconstructed within the WILL Geometry model, from the single foundational Principle without any external assumptions or coordinate backgrounds ) — including precise predictions about the onset of horizon formation, radial pressure gradients, and the resolution of classical singularity issues—is reconstructed from this single idea.


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Meaning]
\[
\textbf{Energy is not “inside” space — it defines space through projection.}
\]
\end{tcolorbox}


\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Surface–scaled closure (vs.\ volume filling).} 
Mass follows the algebraic closure $m_0=4\pi r_d^3\rho$ with $\rho=\kappa^2 c^2/(8\pi G r_d^2)$; the $4\pi$ is the spherical projection measure, not a Newtonian volume average.

\item \textbf{Algebraic core (vs.\ differential ansatz).}
The core invariants are algebraic and coordinate-free. Differential relations appear only as auxiliary scaffolding (e.g.\ to express curvature gradients as $P=-\rho c^2$), not as fundamental inputs.

\item \textbf{Natural bounds.}
The constraint for non rotating systems $\kappa^2\le 1$ enforces $\rho\le\rho_{\max}$ and $|P|\le |P_{\max}|=c^4/(8\pi G r_d^2)$, avoiding singularities without extra hypotheses.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Ontological Shift: From Descriptive to Generative Physics}
\label{Generative Physics}
In conventional physics the methodology follows a descriptive paradigm:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Observable phenomena are identified.  
    \item Empirical regularities are codified as ``laws of nature.''  
    \item Mathematical formalisms are constructed to \emph{describe} these regularities.  
\end{enumerate}

Thus, physical laws are always introduced as external assumptions that model what is seen.  
Even in General Relativity, where geometry plays the central role, the equivalence principle and the metric postulate are still external inputs.

The WILL framework inverts this paradigm. Laws are not added on top of observations;  
they are \emph{generated} as inevitable consequences of relational geometry:
\begin{itemize}
    \item There are no independent axioms such as ``inertial mass equals gravitational mass.''  
    \item Such relations appear automatically as algebraic identities enforced by the geometry.  
    \item What classical physics calls ``laws of nature'' are secondary shadows of the single relational principle:
    \[
       \text{SPACETIME} \;\equiv\; \text{ENERGY}.
    \]
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!70!black,title=Key Distinction]
\textbf{Standard Physics:} Laws \emph{describe} what we observe. \\
\textbf{WILL Framework:} Laws are \emph{generated} as necessary products of relational geometry.
\end{tcolorbox}

\noindent
In this sense, the ontological role of physical law is transformed.  
Physics ceases to be a catalog of empirical descriptions, and becomes the logical unfolding of a single relational structure.  
WILL does not merely model observed phenomena --- it demonstrates why no other phenomena are possible.

\section{Axiomatic Foundations Theorem:WILL Relational Geometry (RG) and General Relativity (GR)}
\begin{quote}
“This logical asymmetry does not imply physical superiority a priori; it only states that any empirical support for GR already presupposes relational invariance.” 
\end{quote}

\begin{definition}[GR Core Axioms]
General Relativity (GR) is assumed to rest on the following axioms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(A1)] The spacetime arena is a smooth Lorentzian manifold with metric $g_{\mu\nu}$.
    \item[(A2)] Diffeomorphism invariance (general covariance): the form of physical laws is independent of coordinates.
    \item[(A3)] Local Lorentz invariance / Einstein equivalence principle: locally, spacetime is Minkowskian.
    \item[(A4)] Einstein Field Equations (EFE): $G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[RG One Principle]
RG is based on a single Principle:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(W1)] \textbf{Relational Principle:} All physical magnitudes are defined purely by relations between entities; spacetime is equivalent to energy.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Relationality in GR]
From A2 and A3 it follows that observable quantities in GR are coordinate-independent
and must be expressed relationally. In particular, no absolute magnitudes can serve
as observables.
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}[Bridge: From Relational Principle to GR Axioms]
If the Relational Principle (W1) were false, then physical magnitudes
could in principle be defined in absolute, non-relational terms. 
Such absolutes would provide a hidden external reference structure.
But this contradicts the core of GR:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It violates diffeomorphism invariance (A2), since coordinate independence
    presupposes that only relational quantities are observable.
    \item It undermines the equivalence principle (A3), since local Minkowski structure 
    relies on the impossibility of distinguishing absolute magnitudes from relative ones.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, the negation of W1 directly negates A2 and A3. 
This establishes the logical dependency required for the asymmetry theorem below.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}[Asymmetric Falsifiability of GR and RG]
\label{thm:asymmetry}
Let $\mathsf{GR}$ denote the theory defined by axioms (A1)--(A4),
and let $\mathsf{RG}$ denote the theory defined by Principle (W1).
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If (W1) is empirically falsified, then (A2)--(A3) are also falsified. 
    Hence, $\mathsf{GR}$ is necessarily falsified.
    \item If any of (A1)--(A3) are empirically falsified, $\mathsf{GR}$ collapses,
    but (W1) may still remain valid as a stand-alone principle.
\end{enumerate}
Therefore, there exist possible empirical scenarios in which GR fails
while RG survives, but there exist no scenarios in which RG fails
while GR survives.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
RG is axiomatically more fundamental than GR: 
its sole Principle (W1) is logically included within the core axioms of GR, 
while GR requires additional ontological structures 
(metric geometry, equivalence principle, Einstein equations) that are 
not necessary for the consistency of RG.

\textbf{Conclusion (Axiomatic Inclusion and Asymmetric Falsifiability).} \\
\emph{RG} rests on the single relational Principle (W1). Core GR assumes additional structures (A1--A4). Hence:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If \textbf{W1} is empirically falsified, GR's core (A2--A3) is undermined; thus GR is falsified.
  \item If any of \textbf{A1--A3} is falsified, GR collapses, while \textbf{W1} (and thus RG) may still hold.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, there are scenarios where GR fails and RG survives, but none where RG fails while GR survives.
}; \\
\end{tikzpicture}


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!4,colframe=black!70!black,title=\textbf{Status of General Relativity within RG}]
It is important to emphasize that the RG framework does not \emph{invalidate} the achievements of General Relativity. 
Rather, it \emph{explains them}. All celebrated predictions of GR --- 
gravitational lensing, perihelion precession, photon spheres, ISCO, horizons --- 
emerge in Relation Geometry as direct consequences of the single closure relation 
$\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$. 

Thus, GR is not a rival but a \textbf{specialized, parameter-heavy realization} of 
RG's more general principle. In logical terms: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Relational Geometry can stand without GR, but GR cannot stand without the relational Principle (W1). 
    \item The empirical successes of GR are preserved within RG, but its pathologies 
    (singularities, dependence on dark entities, ambiguous notion of rest) are avoided. 
\end{itemize}

Therefore, GR should be understood as an \textbf{effective approximation} embedded in 
a deeper relational framework. This perspective retains full respect for the historical 
and observational triumphs of Einstein's theory, while at the same time recognizing its 
status as a non-fundamental limit of a more parsimonious principle.

\subsection{Asymmetric Generality}
The correspondence between these frameworks is fundamentally asymmetric. General Relativity, with its reliance on a pre-supposed metric tensor and the formalism of differential geometry, can be viewed as a specific, parameter-heavy instance of the RG's principles. One can derive GR by adding these additional structures to RG's minimalist foundation. Therefore, the choice between them is not one of preference, but of logical generality and parsimony, with RG being presented as the more fundamental underlying structure.


\section{Conclusion}

 WILL Relational Geometry fully reproduces the predictive content and central equations of both Special and General Relativity, while simultaneously addressing their foundational inconsistencies: 
 \begin{itemize}
     \item (1) the lack of an operational definition of local gravitational energy density in GR, 
     \item (2) the artificial separation of kinetic and gravitational energy in SR and GR, and 
     \item (3) the emergence of singularities as pathological artifacts of coordinate-based models. By treating energy and its transformations as the true basis of geometry, RG unifies and extends these frameworks into a fully relational and operationally grounded description of spacetime and energy.
 \end{itemize}

By focusing on the projectional nature of energy, we have shown that spacetime itself is merely the manifestation of energy.

From a single foundational Principle—that spacetime is equivalent to energy—we derived all the mathematical apparatus needed to describe gravitational and relativistic phenomena. This unification, showing that energy, time, space, and mass are merely different projections of the same underlying structure.
\[
\boxed{\text{Special and General Relativity emerge from the same geometric principles.}}
\]
This approach offers distinct advantages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Conceptual clarity — understanding physics through pure geometry
\item Computational efficiency — significantly reducing complexity 
\item Epistemological hygiene — deriving results from minimal assumptions
\item Philosophical depth — redefining our understanding of time, mass, and causality
\end{itemize}

WILL Relational Geometry inverts our fundamental understanding: 

$$\boxed{\text{Spacetime and energy are mutually defining aspects of a single relational structure.}}$$
