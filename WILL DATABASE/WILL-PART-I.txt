\begin{abstract}
This paper, the first in the \textit{WILL} series, applies extreme methodological constraints in constructing a theory and establishes \textit{Relational Geometry (RG)}: a foundational framework where spacetime is not a background arena but an emergent property of energy transformations. 

From a single principle, \textbf{SPACETIME $\equiv$ ENERGY}, it aims to derive the complete geometric structure of physics across physical domains. This equivalence is not postulated but derived by removing the hidden ontological assumption, implicit in modern physics, that structure (spacetime) and dynamics (energy) are separate phenomena. 

This shift establishes an ontological transition from \textit{descriptive} to \textit{generative} physics: instead of introducing laws to model observations, it derives them as necessary consequences of RG itself — turning physics from a catalogue of phenomena into the logical unfolding of a single principle. 

The result is a singularity-free, ontologically clean formalism that reproduces the core equations of Special Relativity (SR) and General Relativity (GR) as geometric projections on closed relational manifolds $S^1$ (directional) and $S^2$ (omnidirectional). Without metrics, tensors, or free parameters, it reproduces Lorentz factors, the energy–momentum relation, Schwarzschild and Kerr solutions, and Einstein field equations via the dimensionless projections $\beta$ (kinematic) and $\kappa$ (potential). All known GR critical surfaces (photon sphere, ISCO, horizons) emerge as simple fractions of $(\kappa,\beta)$ from the single closure law $\kappa^2=2\beta^2$ (geometrically derived, virial-like).  
All results are empirically validated (e.g., GPS time shift 38.52~$\mu$s/day, Mercury precession to $10^{-10}$\%, and others listed in Appendix~I).

\textit{WILL Part~I} offers solutions to several long-standing problems, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Resolution of GR singularities (via naturally bounded $\rho_{\max}$),
    \item Derivation of the equality of gravitational and inertial masses (from the common channel of rest-invariant scaling),
    \item Removal of local energy ambiguity $\rho=\frac{\kappa^{2}c^{2}}{8\pi G r^{2}}$,
    \item Revelation of a clear relational symmetry between kinematic and potential projections,
    \item Establishment of a computationally simpler and ontologically consistent foundation for subsequent papers on cosmology (Part~II) and quantum mechanics (Part~III).
\end{itemize}
\end{abstract}

\section{Foundational Approach}
\begin{quote}
  \textit{This Approach Does not Describe Physics; it Generates it. \ref{Generative Physics}}
\end{quote}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Guiding Principle:]
\[
\boxed{\text{\textbf{\textbf{Nothing is assumed. Everything is derived.}}}}
\]
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection {Methodological Purity}
This framework is constructed under a single epistemic constraint: to derive all of physics by \textbf{removing one hidden assumption}, rather than introducing new postulates. This construction is deliberate and contains zero free parameters.  This is not a simplification - it is a deliberate epistemic constraint. No assumptions are introduced unless they follow strictly from first principles, and no constructs are retained unless they are geometrically or energetically necessary. 

\begin{principle}[Methodological Minimalism]
\label{pr:minimalism}
Any fundamental theory must proceed from the minimum possible number of ontological assumptions. The burden of proof lies with any assertion that introduces additional complexity or new entities. This principle is not a statement about the nature of reality, but a rule of logical hygiene for constructing a theory.
\end{principle}

\subsection*{No Ontological Commitments}
This model makes no ontological claims about the "existence" of space, particles, or fields. Instead, all phenomena are treated as observer-dependent relational projections.

\subsection{Epistemic Hygiene}
Modern physics often tolerates hidden assumptions: arbitrary constants, external backgrounds, or abstract entities with ambiguous physical status. 
Here we enforce \textbf{epistemic hygiene}: a refusal to import unjustified assumptions. 
\begin{quote}
\textit{
Mathematics is a language, not a world. Its symbols must never outnumber the physical meanings they encode.
}
\end{quote}
\begin{principle}[Relational Origin]
\label{pr:relational}
 \emph{All physical quantities must be defined by their relations.} 
Any introduction of absolute properties or external frames risks reintroducing metaphysical artifacts and contradicts the foundational insight of relativity.
\end{principle}

\subsection{Mathematical Transparency}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each mathematical object must correspond to explicitly identifiable relation between observers with transparent ontological origin.
    \item Every symbol must be anchored to unique  physical idea. 
    \item Introducing symbols  without explicit necessity constitutes \textit{semantic inflation}: the proliferation of symbols without corresponding physical meaning.
    \item Number of symbols = Number of independent physical ideas.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Ontological Blind Spot In Modern Physics}

The standard formulation of General Relativity often relies on the concept of an asymptotically flat spacetime, introducing an implicit external reference frame beyond the physical systems under study. 
While some modern approaches (e.g., shape dynamics) seek greater relationality, we proceed from strict epistemic minimalism, disallowing all background structures, even hidden or asymptotic ones. 

\subsection{Historical Pattern: breakthroughs delete, not add}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Copernicus} eliminated the Earth/cosmos separation.
  \item \textbf{Newton} eliminated the terrestrial/celestial law separation.
  \item \textbf{Einstein} eliminated the space/time separation.
  \item \textbf{Maxwell} eliminated the electricity/magnetism separation.
\end{itemize}
Each step widened the relational circle and reduced the number of
unexplained absolutes.  The spacetime--energy split is the only
survivor of this pruning sequence.

\subsection{The contemporary split: an unpaid ontological bill}
All present-day theories (SR, GR, QFT, ΛCDM, Standard Model) are
built with a \emph{bi-variable} syntax:
\[
\underbrace{\text{fixed manifold + metric}}_{\text{structure}}
\quad+\quad
\underbrace{\text{fields + constants}}_{\text{dynamics}}.
\]
No observation demands this duplication; it is retained purely
because the resulting Lagrangians are empirically adequate
\emph{inside} the split.  The split is therefore \emph{not} an
empirical discovery but an unpaid ontological debt.

\subsection{Empirical bankruptcy of the separation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Local energy conservation} verified only \emph{after} the
        metric is declared fixed; no experiment varies the \emph{volume} of
        flat space and checks calorimetry.
  \item \textbf{Universality of free fall} tests $m_i=m_g$ numerically, not
        the claim that inertia resides \emph{in} the object rather than in
        a geometric scaling relation.
  \item \textbf{Gravitational-wave polarisations} test spin content, not
        ontology; extra modes can still be called ``matter on spacetime''.
  \item \textbf{Casimir/Lamb shift} measure \emph{differences} of vacuum
        energy between two geometries; the absolute bulk term is explicitly
        subtracted, leaving the split intact.
\end{itemize}
In short, every ``test'' is an \emph{internal consistency check} of
a formalism that already presupposes two substances.  None constitute
\emph{positive evidence} for the split.

\subsection{Consequence}
Until an experiment varies the amount of space while holding
everything else fixed, the spacetime--energy separation remains an
\emph{un-evidenced metaphysical postulate}---the last geocentric
epicycle in physics.


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary]
Any attempt to treat \emph{``spacetime structure''} as separate from \emph{``dynamics''} smuggles in a background container that is not justified by the phenomena. This violates epistemic hygiene: it introduces an ontological artifact without necessity. Eliminating this separation compels the identification of structure and dynamics as two aspects of a single entity.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Unifying Principle Removing the Hidden Assumption}

\subsection{False Separation}
\begin{lemma}[False Separation]
\label{lem:false-separation}
Any model that treats processes as unfolding \emph{within} an independent background necessarily assigns to that background structural features (metric, orientation, or frame) not derivable from the relations among the processes themselves. Such a background constitutes an \emph{extraneous absolute}.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Suppose an independent background exists. Then at least one of its structural attributes - metric relations, a preferred orientation, or a class of inertial frames - remains fixed regardless of interprocess data. This attribute is not relationally inferred but posited a priori. It thereby violates the relational closure principle: it introduces a non-relational absolute external to the system. Hence the separation is illicit.  
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Structure--Dynamics Coincidence]
\label{cor:coincidence}
To avoid the artifact of Lemma~\ref{lem:false-separation}, the structural arena and the dynamical content must be identified: geometry \emph{is} energy, and energy \emph{is} geometry.
\end{corollary}
    
\begin{principle}[Working Principle: Removing the Hidden Assumption]
\label{pr:unifying}
\[
\boxed{\textbf{SPACETIME} \;\equiv\; \textbf{ENERGY}}
\]
This is not introduced as a new ontological entity but as a Principle with 
\emph{negative ontological weight}: it removes the hidden unjustified separation 
between “geometry” and “dynamics.” Space and time are not containers but 
emergent descriptors of relational energy.
\end{principle}

\begin{remark}[Auditability]
Principle~\ref{pr:unifying} is foundational but testable: it is subject to (i) geometric audit (internal logical consequences) and (ii) empirical audit (agreement with empirical data).
\end{remark}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary:]
\textbf{This Principle does not add, it subtracts: it removes the hidden assumption.  Structure and dynamics are two aspects of a single entity that we call - WILL.}
\end{tcolorbox}


\subsection{What is Energy in Relational Framework?}
\begin{quote}
Across all domains of physics, one empirical fact persists: in every closed system there exists a quantity that never disappears or arises spontaneously, but only transforms in form. This invariant is observed under many guises --- kinetic, potential, thermal, quantum --- yet all are interchangeable, pointing to a single underlying structure.
Crucially, this quantity is never observed directly, but only through \textit{differences between states}: a change of velocity, a shift in configuration, a transition of phase. Its value is relational, not absolute: it depends on the chosen frame or comparison, never on an object in isolation.
Moreover, this quantity provides continuity of causality. If it changes in one part of the system, a complementary change must occur elsewhere, ensuring the unbroken chain of transitions. Thus it is the bookkeeping of causality itself.
From these empirical and relational facts the definition follows unavoidably:
\end{quote}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Energy :]
\[
\begin{array}{c} \boxed{ 
\begin{array}{c} 
\text{Energy is the relational measure of difference between possible states,} \\
\text{ conserved in any closed whole.} \\ 
\text{It is not an intrinsic property of an object, but }\textbf{ comparative structure}\\ 
\text{ between states (and observers), always manifesting as transformation. }
\end{array} 
} \end{array}
\]
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Deriving the WILL Structure}

Having established our  Principle ~\ref{pr:unifying} by removing the illicit separation of structure and dynamics, we now proceed to derive its necessary geometric and physical consequences. We will demonstrate that this single principle is sufficient to enforce the closure, conservation, and isotropy of the relational structure, leading to a unique set of geometric carriers for energy.

\begin{definition}[WILL]
\label{def:will}
\emph{$ \textbf{WILL}\equiv\ \textbf{SPACE-TIME-ENERGY} $} is the technical term we use for unified relational structure determined by \ref{pr:unifying} . All physically meaningful quantities are relational features of WILL; no external container is permitted.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Closure]
\label{lem:closure}
Under  \ref{pr:unifying}, WILL is self-contained: there is no external reservoir into or from which the relational resource can flow.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
If WILL were not self-contained, there would exist an external structure mediating exchange. That external structure would then serve as a background distinct from the dynamics, contradicting Corollary~\ref{cor:coincidence}.  
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Conservation]
\label{lem:conservation}
Within WILL, the total relational ``transformation resource'' (energy) is conserved.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By Lemma~\ref{lem:closure}, no external fluxes exist. Any change in one part of WILL must be balanced by complementary change elsewhere. Hence a conserved global quantity is enforced at the relational level.  
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[Isotropy from Background--Free Relationality]
\label{lem:isotropy}
If no external background is allowed (Cor.~\ref{cor:coincidence}), then no direction can be \emph{a priori} privileged. Thus the admissible relational geometry of WILL must be maximally symmetric (isotropic and homogeneous) at the level at which it encodes the conserved resource.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
A privileged direction requires an extrinsic reference to distinguish it. In a purely relational setting, distinctions must be constructible from relations internal to WILL. If a direction were privileged in the geometry that encodes the conserved resource, such privilege would not be derivable from purely internal comparisons (which are symmetric by construction), and would reintroduce an external orienting structure. Therefore the encoding geometry must be maximally symmetric.  
\end{proof}

\subsection{Classification of Minimal Relational Transformations}

The lemmas of Closure, Conservation, and Isotropy establish the necessary properties of any geometric carrier of the relational resource. To identify these carriers, we must first classify the simplest possible types of physical relations that can exist in a background-free framework, according to the Principle of Methodological Minimalism (\ref{pr:minimalism}).

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Directional (Kinematic) Relation:}
    The simplest possible non-trivial relation is between two distinct states (A and B). The minimal description of this directed relation requires only a single degree of freedom (the axis connecting A and B). Per Principle~\ref{pr:minimalism}, introducing additional dimensions would be an unjustified complication. For this description to be self-contained (Lemma~\ref{lem:closure}), the 1D geometry must be closed. This uniquely specifies the circle ($S^1$) as the necessary and sufficient carrier for minimal directional relations.

    \item \textbf{Omnidirectional (Gravitational) Relation:}
    The simplest possible isotropic relation is between a central state (A) and the locus of all states equidistant to it. The minimal description for all directions of this relation requires a surface representing all possible orientations from the center. Such a surface has two degrees of freedom (corresponding to the two angles needed to specify a direction). For this description to be closed and maximally symmetric (Lemmas~\ref{lem:closure}, \ref{lem:isotropy}), the geometry must be that of a 2-sphere ($S^2$). It is the necessary and sufficient carrier for minimal omnidirectional relations.
\end{enumerate}

The Principle of Methodological Minimalism thus restricts the admissible relational geometries to these two minimal classes. The following theorem provides their formal identification.

\begin{theorem}[Minimal Relational Carriers of the Conserved Resource]
\label{thm:carriers}
The only closed, maximally symmetric manifolds that can serve as minimal carriers of the conserved relational resource are:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item \(S^1\) for \emph{directional} (one-degree-of-freedom) relational transformation;
        \item \(S^2\) for \emph{omnidirectional} (central, all-directions-equivalent) relational transformation.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By Lemma~\ref{lem:isotropy}, we require closed, maximally symmetric manifolds. 

(a) In one relational degree of freedom, the classification of connected closed $1$-manifolds yields \(S^1\) as the unique (up to diffeomorphism) option. Its isometry group acts transitively with isotropy at each point, providing maximal symmetry.

(b) For omnidirectional relational transformation from a distinguished center, the encoding manifold must be a closed, simply connected, constant positive curvature $2$-manifold with full isotropy at every point. By the uniformization/classification of constant-curvature surfaces, the maximally symmetric representative is \(S^2\). Quotients of \(S^2\) by nontrivial finite groups introduce global identifications that spoil global isotropy; these are excluded by Lemma~\ref{lem:isotropy}. Hence \(S^2\) is uniquely selected.  
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Uniqueness]
\label{cor:uniqueness}
Under \ref{pr:unifying} with Closure, Conservation, and Isotropy (Lemmas \ref{lem:closure}--\ref{lem:isotropy}), \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) are \emph{necessary} relational carriers for, respectively, directional and omnidirectional modes of energy transformation.
\end{corollary}

\begin{remark}[Non-spatial Reading]
\label{rem:nonspatial}
Throughout, \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) are not to be interpreted as \emph{spacetime} geometries. They are \emph{relational manifolds} that encode the closure, conservation, and isotropy of the transformational resource. Ordinary spatial and temporal notions are emergent descriptors of patterns within WILL.
\end{remark}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary:]
From removing the hidden assumption ~\ref{lem:false-separation} we inevitably arrive to \ref{pr:unifying}   \(\text{SPACETIME}\equiv\text{ENERGY}\) from there we deduced: (i) closure, (ii) conservation, (iii) isotropy, and hence (iv) the unique selection of \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) as minimal relational carriers for directional and omnidirectional transformation. These objects are non-spatial encodings of conservation and symmetry; they are enforced by the\ref{pr:unifying} rather than assumed independently.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Ontological Status of the Relational Manifolds \(S^1\) and \(S^2\)}

A natural question arises regarding the ontological status of the circle \(S^1\) and the sphere \(S^2\): What are they, and where do they "exist"?

The answer requires a fundamental shift in perspective. In WILL Relational Geometry, \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) are \textbf{not spatial entities} existing within a pre-defined container. They are the necessary \textbf{relational architectures} that implement the core identity \(\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY}\).

\paragraph{Energy as Relational Bookkeeping}
Recall that energy is defined as the \textit{relational measure of difference between possible states}. It is not an intrinsic property but a comparative structure that guarantees causal continuity. It is never observed directly, only through transformations.

\paragraph{The Manifolds as Protocols of Interaction}
The manifolds \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) are the minimal, unique mathematical structures capable of hosting this relational "bookkeeping" for directional and omnidirectional transformations, respectively. They enforce closure, conservation, and symmetry by their very topology.

Imagine two observers, \(A\) and \(B\):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Observer \(A\) is the center of their own relational framework. Observer \(B\) is a point on \(A\)'s \(S^1\) (for kinematic relations) and \(S^2\) (for gravitational relations).
    \item Simultaneously, observer \(B\) is the center of their own framework. Observer \(A\) is a point on \(B\)'s \(S^1\) and \(S^2\).
\end{itemize}
There is no privileged "master" manifold. Each observable interaction is structured by these mutually-centered relational protocols. The parameters \(\beta\) and \(\kappa\) are the coordinates within these relational dimensions, and the conservation laws (e.g., \(\beta_X^2 + \beta_Y^2 = 1; \quad \kappa_X^2 + \kappa_Y^2 = 1\)) are the innate accounting rules of these protocols.

\paragraph{Emergence of Spacetime}
Therefore, the question "Where are \(S^1\) and \(S^2\)?" is a category error. They are not \textit{in} space; they are the structures whose coordinated, multi-centered interactions \textbf{give rise to} the phenomenon we perceive as spacetime. Spacetime is the emergent, collective shadow cast by the dynamics of energy relations projected onto these architectures.

In essence, \(S^1\) and \(S^2\) are the ontological embodiment of the relational principle. They are derived as the only possible structures that can house the transformational resource (energy) in a closed, conserved, and isotropic system. Their status is that of a fundamental \textbf{relational geometry} from which physics is generated.

\section{Emergence of Spacetime}

\textit{In this construction, ``space,'' ``time,'' are not treated as separate, fundamental aspects of reality. Instead, they are shown to arise as necessary consequences of a single, underlying principle: the geometry of a closed, relational system.}

\subsection{The Duality of Transformation}

\begin{lemma}[Duality of Evolution]
\label{lem:duality}
The identification of spacetime with energy and its transformations necessitates two complementary relational measures:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the \textbf{extent} of transformation (external displacement), and
    \item the \textbf{sequence} of transformation (internal order).
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Any complete description of transformation must specify both what changes and how that change is internally ordered. A single measure cannot capture both. The circle $S^1$ provides the minimal geometry enforcing such complementarity: its orthogonal projections furnish precisely two non-redundant coordinates.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{ We define this orthogonal projections as follows:}

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{The Amplitude Component ($\beta_X$):} This projection represents the \textit{relational measure} between the system and the observer. It corresponds to the \textit{extent} of transformation, which manifests physically as momentum (as shown in next section).

    \item \textbf{The Phase Component ($\beta_Y$):} This projection represents the \textit{internal structure} of a system. It governs the intrinsic scale of its proper space and proper time units, corresponding to the \textit{sequence} of its transformation. A value of $\beta_Y=1$ represents a complete and undisturbed manifestation of this internal structure, a state we identify as rest.


\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conservation Law of Relational Transformation}

\begin{theorem}[Conservation Law of Relational transformation]
\label{thm:conservation}
The orthogonal components of transformation $(\beta_X,\beta_Y)$ are bound by the closure relation
\[
\beta_X^2 + \beta_Y^2 = 1.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Since $S^1$ is closed, every point on the circle is constrained by the Pythagorean identity of its projections. Thus no state can exceed or fall short of the finite relational "budget." This closure enforces conservation across all processes. 
\end{proof}

The manifestation of any system is distributed between its internal (Phase) and relational (Amplitude) aspects. This single geometric constraint gives rise to the core phenomena of modern physics:

\subsection{Consequence: Relativistic Effects}

\begin{proposition}[Physical Interpretation: Relativistic Effects]
\label{prop:relativity}
The conservation law of Theorem~\ref{thm:conservation} implies that any redistribution between 
the orthogonal components $(\beta_X,\beta_Y)$ manifests physically as the relativistic effects of 
time dilation and length contraction.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{thm:conservation}, the components satisfy $\beta_X^2 + \beta_Y^2 = 1$. 
An increase in the relational displacement $\beta_X$ enforces a decrease in the internal measure $\beta_Y$. 
This reduction of $\beta_Y$ corresponds to dilation of proper time and contraction of proper length, 
while the growth of $\beta_X$ represents momentum. 
Thus the relativistic trade-off is the direct physical expression of the geometric closure of $S^1$.  
\end{proof}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary:]
\textbf{Geometry of spacetime is the shadow cast by the geometry of relations.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Kinetic Energy Projection on $S^1$}

Since $S^{1}$ encodes one-dimensional displacement, the total energy $E$ of the system 
must project consistently onto both axes:
\[
E_{X} = E \beta_{X}, 
\qquad 
E_{Y} = E \beta_{Y}.
\]

\begin{theorem}[Invariant Projection of Rest Energy]
\label{thm:restenergy}
For any state $(\beta_X,\beta_Y)$ on the relational circle, the vertical projection of the total energy is invariant:
\[
E \beta_Y = E_0.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
When $\beta_X=0$, closure enforces $\beta_Y=1$, yielding $E=E_0$. 
Since closure applies for all $\theta_1$, the vertical projection $E\beta_Y$ 
remains equal to this rest value in every state.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Total Energy Relation]
\label{cor:totalE}
From Theorem~\ref{thm:restenergy} it follows that
\[
E = \frac{E_0}{\beta_Y} 
= \frac{E_0}{\sqrt{\,1-\beta_X^2\,}}.
\]
\end{corollary}

\begin{remark}[Lorentz Factor]
The historical Lorentz factor $\gamma$ is nothing more than the reciprocal of $\beta_Y$. 
No additional structure is introduced: all content is already present in $E\beta_Y=E_0$.
\end{remark}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary:]
\textbf{The historical Lorentz factor $\gamma$ is the reciprocal of $\beta_Y$.  $\gamma =  1/\beta_Y$}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Rest Energy and Mass Equivalence}

\begin{corollary}[Rest Energy and Mass Equivalence]
\label{cor:restmass}
Within the normalization $c=1$, the invariant rest energy equals mass:
\[
E_{0} = m.
\]
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
From the invariant projection $E\beta_Y = E_0$ and closure of $S^1$, no additional scaling parameter is required. 
Hence the conventional bookkeeping identities $E_0 = mc^2$ or $m = E_0/c^2$ reduce to tautologies. 
Mass is therefore not independent, but the rest-energy invariant itself.  
\end{proof}


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary:]
\textbf{Mass is the invariant projection of total rest energy.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Energy--Momentum Relation}

\begin{proposition}[Horizontal Projection as Momentum]
\label{prop:momentum}
On the relational circle, the unique relational measure of displacement from rest is the horizontal projection $E\beta_X$; hence
\[
p \equiv E\beta_X \quad (c=1).
\]
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
The rest state is $(\beta_X,\beta_Y)=(0,1)$. A displacement measure must (i) vanish at rest, (ii) grow monotonically with $|\beta_X|$, and (iii) flip sign under $\beta_X\mapsto -\beta_X$. The only relational candidate satisfying (i)–(iii) is the horizontal projection $E\beta_X$. Thus the identification is necessary rather than conventional.  
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}[Energy--Momentum Relation]
\label{cor:energymomentum}
With $p$ identified by Proposition~\ref{prop:momentum} and $m=E_0$, the closure identity yields
\[
E^{2} = p^{2} + m^{2} \quad (c=1).
\]
Equivalently, upon restoring $c$,
\[
E^{2} = (pc)^{2} + (mc^{2})^{2}.
\]
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
By closure, $(E\beta_X)^2 + (E\beta_Y)^2 = E^2$. Substituting $p=E\beta_X$ and $m=E_0$ proves the claim. 
Restoring $c$ is dimensional bookkeeping: $p\mapsto pc$ and $m\mapsto mc^{2}$, while $E$ remains $E$, yielding the standard form. 
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Geometric Forms]
The same identity may be expressed explicitly in terms of circle coordinates:
\[
E^{2} = \left(\tfrac{\beta_X}{\beta_Y}E_0\right)^{2} + E_0^{2}
= \bigl(\cot(\theta_{1})\,E_{0}\bigr)^{2} + E_{0}^{2}.
\]
These are equivalent renderings 
of the same geometric necessity.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Units sanity check — bookkeeping]
Using $\beta_X = v/c$, the identification $p \equiv E\beta_X$ gives
\[
pc = E\,\frac{v}{c}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad p = \frac{E\,v}{c^{2}}.
\]
With $E=\frac{1}{\beta_Y} mc^{2}=\gamma mc^{2}$ this reduces to $p=\frac{\beta_X}{\beta_Y}mc=\gamma m v$, the standard relativistic momentum. No new parameters are introduced.
\end{remark}

\textbf{The energy--momentum relation $E^{2} = (pc)^{2} + (mc^{2})^{2}$ is geometric identity of $S^1$.}

\section{Potential Energy Projection on $S^2$}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=IMPORTANT:]
\textbf{Throughout this work, $S^1$ and $S^2$ are not to be interpreted as spacetime geometries but purely as relational manifolds encoding conservation. Any reading otherwise is a misinterpretation.}
\end{tcolorbox}

Analogous to $S^1$ the relational geometry of the sphere, $S^2$, provides orthogonal projections,  for two aspects of omnidirectional transformation. We define them as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Amplitude Component ($\kappa_Y$):} This projection represents the \textit{relational gravitational measure} between the object and the observer. It corresponds to the \textit{extent} of transformation, which manifests physically as gravitation potential. A value of $\kappa_Y=1$ corresponds precisely to the point where escape velocity equals the speed of light, creating an event horizon. This provides a natural causal limit for our gravitational parameter, analogous to the relative motion it determinant by the same radial normalization.

    \item \textbf{The Phase Component}\textbf{ ($\kappa_X$):} This projection governs the intrinsic scale of its proper length and proper time units, corresponding to the \textit{sequence} of its transformation.
\end{itemize}

These two components are not independent but are bound by the fundamental conservation law of the closed system, which acts as a finite ``budget of transformation'':
$$
\kappa_X^2 + \kappa_Y^2 = 1
$$
The manifestation of any system is distributed between its internal (Phase) and relational (Amplitude) aspects. This single geometric constraint gives rise to the core phenomena of modern physics.
\begin{quote}
    \subsection{Gravitational Meridional Section of $S^2$}
By isotropy the omnidirectional carrier is $S^2$, but any radially symmetric
exchange reduces to a great-circle meridional section. We therefore work on a
unit great circle of $S^2$ with the parametrization
$(\kappa_X,\kappa)=(\cos\theta_2,\sin\theta_2)$.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Consequence: Gravitational Effects}

The redistribution of the budget between the Phase and Amplitude components directly produces the effects of General Relativity. An increase in the relational measure ($\kappa_Y$, gravitation potential) necessarily requires a decrease in the measure of the internal structure ($\kappa_X$). This geometric trade-off is observed physically as gravitational length and time corrections. Thus, the geometry of spacetime is the shadow cast by the geometry of relations.


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Notation simplicity:]
From here on we will write  \(\beta=\beta_X , \quad \beta_Y=\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}},\quad  \kappa=\kappa_Y , \qquad \kappa_{X} = \sqrt{1 - \kappa^{2}}\) for notation simplicity.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Gravitational Tangent Formulation}

Just as the relativistic energy--momentum relation can be expressed in terms of the kinematic projection 
$\beta = v/c$, we may construct its gravitational analogue using the potential projection $\kappa = v_{e}/c$, where $v_{e}$ is the escape velocity at radius $r$. 

In the kinematic case, with $\beta = \cos\theta_{1}$, the energy relation can be written as
\begin{equation}
    E^{2} = \bigl(\cot\theta_{1}\,E_{0}\bigr)^{2} + E_{0}^{2},
\end{equation}
so that the relativistic momentum is expressed as
\begin{equation}
    p = E_{0}/c\,\cot\theta_{1}.
\end{equation}

In full symmetry, the gravitational case follows from $\kappa = \sin\theta_{2}$. 
We define the gravitational energy as
\begin{equation}
    E_{g} = \frac{E_{0}}{\kappa_{X}}, 
    \qquad \kappa_{X} = \sqrt{1 - \kappa^{2}},
\end{equation}
and introduce the gravitational analogue of momentum:
\begin{equation}
    p_g \;=\; E_{0}/c\,\tan\theta_{2}.
\end{equation}

This yields the gravitational energy relation
\begin{equation}
    E_{g}^{2} = (p_gc)^{2} + (mc^{2})^{2}.
\end{equation}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!60!black, title=Summary:]
\[
\beta = \cos\theta_{1}, 
\qquad 
\kappa = \sin\theta_{2},
\]
\[
\beta \;\longleftrightarrow\; \kappa,
\qquad
\cot\theta_{1} \;\longleftrightarrow\; \tan\theta_{2}.
\]

Kinematic momentum $p$ and gravitational momentum $p_g$ are thus dual 
projections of the same relational circle, expressed through complementary 
trigonometric forms.
\end{tcolorbox}


\subsection{Geometric composition of SR and GR factors}

On the unit kinematic circle ($S^1$) we parametrize
\[
(\beta,\beta_Y)=(\cos\theta_1,\ \sin\theta_1),
\]
so that the invariant vertical projection reads
\[
E\,\beta_Y=E_0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad 
\boxed{\,E=\dfrac{E_0}{\beta_Y}=\dfrac{E_0}{\sin\theta_1}\,},\qquad
p= \frac{E}{c}\,\beta=\dfrac{E_0\,\beta}{\beta_Y}=E_0\cot\theta_1,
\]
and therefore \(E^2=(pc)^2+E_0^2\).

On the gravitational circle  ($S^2$) we parametrize
\[
(\kappa_X,\kappa)=(\cos\theta_2,\ \sin\theta_2),
\]
so that the invariant horizontal projection reads
\[
E_g\,\kappa_X=E_0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad 
\boxed{\,E_g=\dfrac{E_0}{\kappa_X}=\dfrac{E_0}{\cos\theta_2}\,},\qquad
p_g=E_g\,\kappa=\dfrac{E_0\,\kappa}{\kappa_X}=E_0\tan\theta_2,
\]
and therefore \(E_g^2=p_g^2+E_0^2\).

\end{tcolorbox}



\section{Equivalence Principle as Derived Identity}

\begin{lemma}[Unified Relational Scaling]
\label{lem:unifiedscaling}
Within the relational framework of WILL, both kinematic ($S^1$) and gravitational ($S^2$)
transformations act as independent projections of the same invariant energy $E_0$. 
Each projection rescales the observable quantities by its respective geometric factor:
\[
E = \frac{E_0}{\beta_Y}, \qquad 
E_g = \frac{E_0}{\kappa_X}.
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
On the kinematic circle $S^1$, the invariant vertical projection corresponds to $\beta_Y=\sin\theta_1$.
Preserving the same invariant leg $E_0$ forces the stretch $E/E_0 = 1/\beta_Y$.  
On the gravitational sphere $S^2$, the invariant horizontal projection is $\kappa_X=\cos\theta_2$, 
forcing $E_g/E_0 = 1/\kappa_X$. 
These transformations are independent and commute, 
each preserving the closure identity of its respective manifold.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Equivalence of Inertial and Gravitational Response]
\label{thm:equivalence}
Composing the independent relational stretches of Lemma~\ref{lem:unifiedscaling} yields the total local energy scale
\[
E_{\mathrm{loc}} =  \frac{E_0}{ \tau}=\frac{E_0}{\beta_Y\,\kappa_X}
= \frac{E_0}{\sqrt{(1-\beta^2)(1-\kappa^2)}} .
\]
The corresponding inertial and gravitational projections share a single operational factor,
\[
\tilde p =\frac{E_{\mathrm{loc}}}{c}\beta, 
\qquad 
\tilde p_g =\frac{E_{\mathrm{loc}}}{c} \kappa, 
\]
both governed by the same effective mass
\[
m_{\mathrm{eff}} = \frac{E_0}{\beta_Y\,\kappa_X \, c^2}= \frac{E_0}{ \tau c^2}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
\boxed{\,m_g \equiv m_i \equiv m_{\mathrm{eff}}\,},
\]
and the Einstein equivalence principle follows as a necessary structural identity of WILL.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}[Mass Invariance under Relational Scaling]
\label{cor:massinvariance}
The invariant core $E_0$ denotes the complete internal equilibrium state 
($\beta_Y=\kappa_X=1$). 
Relational factors $\beta_Y$ and $\kappa_X$ rescale only external manifestations 
(energy, momentum, and rates), while $E_0$ remains unchanged. 
Hence,
\[
\boxed{\,m_g \equiv m_i \equiv m = E_0/c^2\,},
\]
is not a dynamical statement but the definition of rest invariance itself.
\end{corollary}

\begin{remark}[Composition-Independence]
Decomposing the invariant rest energy into internal channels,
\[
E_0=\sum_{a} E_0^{(a)},
\]
each term couples identically through the same geometric stretch:
\[
E_{\mathrm{loc}}=\sum_a \frac{E_0^{(a)}}{\tau}.
\]
Since all channels scale by the same factor $1/\tau=1/(\beta_Y\kappa_X)$,
ratios between channels cancel in all observables.  
Therefore, composition-independence of motion (Eötvös universality) follows identically, 
without requiring a postulate $m_g=m_i$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Quantum Interface]
The relational phase increment inherits the same scaling:
\[
\Delta\phi \propto E_{\mathrm{loc}}\,\Delta\lambda,
\]
where $\Delta\lambda$ is the internal ordering parameter. 
Thus both kinematic and gravitational phase shifts share the same stretch 
$1/\tau=1/(\beta_Y\kappa_X)$, 
yielding composition-independent matter-wave interference patterns.
\end{remark}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary:]
\textbf{In WILL, the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass is not assumed but 
follows necessarily from the compositional closure of relational geometry. 
What General Relativity posits as a postulate, WILL reveals as a corollary.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Unification of Projections: The Geometric Exchange Rate}

Having established that directional (kinematic) and omnidirectional (gravitational) relations are carried by the unique manifolds $S^1$ and $S^2$ respectively, we now derive the relationship that unifies them.

\subsection{Derivation of the Energetic Closure Condition}

The Principle of a unified relational resource (Energy) requires a self-consistent "exchange rate" between its different modes of expression. This rate is not an arbitrary parameter but is dictated by the intrinsic geometry of the relations themselves:

\begin{lemma}[Dimensional Ratio of Relational Modes]
\label{lem:dofratio}
Directional (kinematic) and omnidirectional (gravitational) modes of WILL are carried by $S^1$ and $S^2$, requiring one and two degrees of freedom respectively.  
The intrinsic ratio of their relational dimensionalities is therefore
\[
\frac{\text{deg}(S^2)}{\text{deg}(S^1)} = \frac{2}{1} = 2,
\]
formally realized as the ratio of their total solid angles:
\[
\frac{\Omega(S^2)}{\Omega(S^1)} = \frac{4\pi}{2\pi} = 2.
\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[Energetic Closure Condition]
\label{thm:closure}
Since energy is quadratic in its relational amplitudes, the unique quadratic balance between
directional ($S^1$) and omnidirectional ($S^2$) resource distributions compatible with closure is
\[
\boxed{\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2.}
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The relational resource of WILL is conserved under redistribution between its kinematic and gravitational
modes. Given the dimensional ratio of Lemma~\ref{lem:dofratio}, an omnidirectional transformation consumes twice the relational degrees of freedom of a directional one.  
The energetic significance of a state is proportional not to the amplitude of a projection ($\beta$, $\kappa$), but to its \textbf{square} ($\beta^2$, $\kappa^2$). This principle is ubiquitous, reflected in the Pythagorean (sum-of-squares) structure of the relational manifolds themselves. There for the corresponding energetic relation is quadratic: $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Closure Defect]
\(\delta \equiv \kappa^2 - 2\beta^2.\)
A subsystem is \emph{energetically closed} iff \(\langle\delta\rangle_{\text{cycle}}=0.\)
For circular orbits, \(\delta \equiv 0.\)
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}[Energetic Closure Criterion]
\label{cor:closurecriterion}
Closed systems (momentary or periodic) satisfy $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$ identically.  
Open systems display $\delta \neq 0$, the magnitude of which quantifies the energy flow through unaccounted channels.  
When all channels are included, closure is restored.
\end{corollary}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Diagnostic Invariant:]
\textbf{The condition $\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$ defines energetic closure.  
In closed systems (circular or periodic), it holds exactly;  
in open systems, its deviation $\delta$ measures interaction with external channels.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{remark}[Physical Interpretation]
The exchange rate between the kinematic and gravitational projections corresponds to the ratio of their relational dimensions.  
This purely geometric constant (\(2\)) replaces the empirical proportionalities of classical dynamics.
It is the relational analogue of the \textbf{virial theorem}:  
the kinetic and potential aspects of WILL maintain closure through the invariant ratio
\[
\boxed{\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2.}
\]
\end{remark}

\paragraph{Illustrative Examples.}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Circular Orbit (Closed).}  
A body in circular orbit exactly satisfies $\kappa^2=2\beta^2$.  
The entire conserved resource is partitioned between kinetic and gravitational projections; no external channel exists.
\item \textbf{Radiating Binary (Open).}  
An elliptical compact binary violates $\kappa^2=2\beta^2$ when only orbital degrees of freedom are counted,  
the closure defect $\delta$ quantifying energy lost to gravitational radiation.  
Including all channels restores closure.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary:]
\begin{enumerate}
\item WILL defines the universe as a closed relational structure, $\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY}$.
\item The simplest maximally symmetric carriers of these relations are \(S^1\) and \(S^2\).
\item The parameters $\beta=\cos\theta_1$ and $\kappa=\sin\theta_2$ are thus constrained to these manifolds.
\item The geometric exchange rate between these modes equals the ratio of their relational dimensionalities: \(2\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{remark}[Geometric Origin of Physical Law]
The relation between kinetic and potential energy is not an empirical coincidence 
but a geometric necessity of relational closure.  
Classical mechanics merely approximates this deeper invariant.  
Explicitly,
\[
\boxed{\text{Geometric Distribution }(\kappa^2)
\;\equiv\;
2\times\text{Kinetic Distribution }(\beta^2).}
\]
\end{remark}

\section{Energy–Symmetry Law}\label{sec:energy-symmetry}

\begin{quote}
    
In RG, every transformation is bidirectional: 
each change observed by $A$ corresponds to an equal and opposite change observed by $B$. 
This reciprocity is the algebraic form of causal continuity, 
and its geometric expression is the Energy–Symmetry Law.

\end{quote}

\subsection{Causal Continuity and Energy Symmetry}
\begin{theorem}[Energy Symmetry]
The specific energy differences (per unit of rest energy) perceived by two observers for a transition between their states balance according to the Energy–Symmetry Law:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Consider two observers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Observer $A$ at rest on the surface at radius $r_A$ (state defined by $\kappa_A, \beta_A=0$).
\item Observer $B$ orbiting at radius $r_B > r_A$ with orbital velocity $v_B$ (state defined by $\kappa_B, \beta_B$).
\end{itemize}
Each observer perceives energy transfers as the sum of the change in potential and kinetic energy budgets.

From $A$'s perspective (transition from surface to orbit):
\begin{enumerate}
\item An object gains potential energy by moving away from the gravitational center.
\item It gains kinetic energy by accelerating to orbital velocity.
\end{enumerate}
The total specific energy required for this transition is the sum of these two contributions:
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\Delta E_{A \to B} = \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}\left(\kappa_A^2 - \kappa_B^2\right)}_{\text{Change in Potential}} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}\left(\beta_B^2 - \beta_A^2\right)}_{\text{Change in Kinetic}}}
\end{equation}
Since observer A is at rest, $\beta_A = 0$, and the expression simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} = \frac{1}{2}\left((\kappa_A^2 - \kappa_B^2) + \beta_B^2\right)
\end{equation}

From $B$'s perspective (transition from orbit to surface):
\begin{enumerate}
\item The object loses potential energy descending into a stronger gravitational field.
\item It loses kinetic energy by reducing its velocity to rest.
\end{enumerate}
This results in a specific energy difference:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{B \to A} = \frac{1}{2}\left((\kappa_B^2 - \kappa_A^2) + (\beta_A^2 - \beta_B^2)\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left((\kappa_B^2 - \kappa_A^2) - \beta_B^2\right)
\end{equation}

Summing these transfers gives:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0
\end{equation}
Thus, no net energy is created or destroyed in a closed cycle of transitions, confirming the Energy–Symmetry Law as a direct consequence of the closed geometry.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The Specific Energy Transfer ($\Delta E$):} This is the physical quantity representing the actual work done and change in motion, corresponding to the classical total energy of a transition (per unit rest energy). It is defined as the \textbf{sum of the changes} in the potential and kinetic energy budgets:
    \begin{equation}
    \Delta E_{A \to B} = \Delta U_{A \to B} + \Delta K_{A \to B} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\kappa_A^2 - \kappa_B^2\right) + \frac{1}{2}\left(\beta_B^2 - \beta_A^2\right)
    \end{equation}
It is this quantity, $\Delta E$, that is conserved and must balance to zero in any closed cycle.
    
When the closure condition for stable, periodic orbits ($\kappa^2 - 2\beta^2 = 0$) is applied, the general Energy-Symmetry Law simplifies into remarkably elegant and direct forms. These simplified equations provide the precise energy balance for transitions involving energetically closed systems, such as planets or satellites in stable orbits.

\paragraph{Case 1: Surface-to-Orbit Transfer.}
For a transfer from a state of rest (A, where $\beta_A = 0$) to a closed orbit (B) where $E_{0B}$ is the objects rest energy, the specific energy balance is given by:
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{A \to B}}{E_{0B}} = \frac{1}{2}(\kappa_A^2 - \beta_B^2)
\end{equation}
This result is derived by applying the closure condition $\kappa_B^2 = 2\beta_B^2$ to the general energy transfer formula, elegantly linking the initial potential projection to the final kinetic projection.

\paragraph{Case 2: Orbit-to-Orbit Transfer.}
For a transfer between two different closed orbits (A and B), the simplification is even more profound. The specific energy balance reduces to:
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{A \to B}}{E_{0B}} = \frac{1}{2}(\beta_A^2 - \beta_B^2)
\end{equation}
In this case, applying the closure condition to both the initial and final orbits causes the potential projection terms ($\kappa^2$) to cancel out completely. The entire energy balance of the transfer is expressed purely as the difference between the squares of the initial and final kinetic projections. This demonstrates a deep symmetry in the energetic structure of stable orbital systems.

\subsection{Physical Meaning of the Factor $\frac{1}{2}$}

The factor $\frac{1}{2}$ does not originate from classical mechanics but from the fundamental quadratic nature of the energy budgets in RG.

The energetic significance of a state is proportional to the \textbf{square} of its geometric projection. This is analogous to how kinetic energy is proportional to velocity squared ($v^2$) or how the energy in a wave is proportional to its amplitude squared ($A^2$). The individual energy budgets are defined as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Specific Potential Energy Budget:} $U/E_0 \propto -\frac{1}{2}\kappa^2$
    \item \textbf{Specific Kinetic Energy Budget:} $K/E_0 = \frac{1}{2}\beta^2$
\end{itemize}
The factor $\frac{1}{2}$ arises naturally when representing a conserved quantity (energy) through a quadratic measure (the square of a projection). The Energy-Symmetry Law deals with the sum of the \textit{changes} in these individual budgets.

\subsection{Universal Speed Limit as a Consequence of Energy Symmetry}
\begin{theorem}[Universal Speed Limit]
The universal speed limit ($v \leq c$) emerges naturally from the requirement of energetic symmetry.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Assume an object could exceed the speed of light, implying $\beta > 1$. In this scenario, its specific kinetic energy budget, $\frac{1}{2}\beta^2$, would become arbitrarily large.

The energy transfer required to reach this state, $\Delta E_{A \to B}$, would also become arbitrarily large. Consequently, no finite physical process could provide a balancing reverse transfer, $\Delta E_{B \to A}$, that would sum to zero. The fundamental symmetry would be broken:
\begin{equation}
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} \neq 0
\end{equation}
Therefore, the condition $\beta \leq 1$ (which implies $v \leq c$) is an intrinsic requirement for maintaining the causal and energetic consistency of the relational universe.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Single–Axis Energy Transfer and the Nature of Light} \label{sec:nature of light}
\begin{theorem}[Single–Axis Transformation Principle]
For light, the kinematic projection reaches its full extent:
\[
\boxed{\beta = 1 \;\Rightarrow\; \beta_Y = 0.}
\]
This means that all transformation of the relational energy occurs along a \textbf{single orthogonal axis}.
The complementary branch of the bidirectional energy exchange is absent, and the total resource of transformation is entirely expressed on one geometric component.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
For massive systems, the Energy–Symmetry Law distributes the total energy exchange evenly between two orthogonal projections:
\[
U/E_0 = -\tfrac{1}{2}\kappa^2, \qquad
K/E_0 = +\tfrac{1}{2}\beta^2.
\]
The symmetry of exchange arises because both branches --- $(\kappa, \kappa_X)$ and $(\beta, \beta_Y)$ --- coexist and compensate each other.
Each side carries one half of the total transformation resource, ensuring
\[
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0.
\]

For light, however, $\beta = 1$ implies $\beta_Y = 0$.
The complementary projection disappears; there is no dual observer-frame available for symmetric partition.
As a result, the transformation cannot be divided between two orthogonal branches.
The full relational resource of the interaction is realised on a single axis.

Therefore, the specific energy potential for light is not halved but complete:
\[
\boxed{\Phi_\gamma = \kappa^2 c^2,}
\]
while for a massive body the potential remains partitioned,
\[
\Phi_{\text{mass}} = \tfrac{1}{2}\kappa^2 c^2.
\]
This explains why light experiences a total geometric effect exactly twice that of a massive particle in the same field, without introducing any auxiliary approximations.
\end{proof}
\begin{quote}
    \textbf{Interpretive Note}
Light occupies the boundary state where relational reciprocity collapses into self-reference.
It is not a “massless limit” but a distinct single-axis state of the energy geometry.
A photon is simultaneously its own counter-frame and its own anti-state.
The factor of two that appears in gravitational deflection and frequency shift is a direct signature of this one-axis transformation.
\end{quote}

\section{Classical Keplerian Energy as a WILL--Minkowski Projection}

A striking consequence of the Energy--Symmetry Law (Section~\ref{sec:energy-symmetry}) emerges when analysing the total specific orbital energy.
Since energy in RG is defined \textit{relationally, as the measure of difference between two states}, we naturally select these two states (e.g., the surface of the central body 'A' and the orbit 'B') as the reference points for the potential and kinetic energy budgets.
Under this relational approach, the total specific orbital energy (potential $+$ kinetic, per unit rest mass) naturally appears in a form\textbf{ structurally identical to the Minkowski interval}.

\subsection{Classical Result with Surface Reference}

For a test body of mass $m$ on a circular orbit of radius $a$ about
a central mass $M_\oplus$ (Earth in our example),
classical Newtonian mechanics gives:
\begin{align}
\Delta U &= -\frac{GM_\oplus m}{a} + \frac{GM_\oplus m}{R_\oplus},\\
K &= \frac12 m\frac{GM_\oplus}{a}.
\end{align}
Adding these and dividing by the rest--energy $E_0 = m c^2$ yields
the dimensionless total:
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{\text{tot}}}{E_0}
= \frac{GM_\oplus}{R_\oplus c^2}
 - \frac12\frac{GM_\oplus}{a c^2}.
\label{eq:classical_surface}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Projection Parameters and Minkowski-like Form}

Define the WILL projection parameters for the surface and the orbit:
\begin{align}
\kappa_\oplus^2 &\equiv \frac{2GM_\oplus}{R_\oplus c^2},\\
\beta_{\text{orbit}}^2 &\equiv \frac{GM_\oplus}{a c^2}.
\end{align}
Substituting into \eqref{eq:classical_surface} gives the exact identity:
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{\text{tot}}}{E_0}
= \frac12\bigl(\kappa_\oplus^2 - \beta_{\text{orbit}}^2\bigr).
\label{eq:will_minkowski_energy}
\end{equation}

This is already in the form of a \emph{hyperbolic difference of squares}:
if we set $x \equiv \kappa_\oplus$ and $y \equiv \beta_{\text{orbit}}$, then
\begin{equation}
\frac{E_{\text{tot}}}{E_0} = \frac12\,(x^2 - y^2),
\end{equation}
which is structurally identical to a Minkowski interval in $(1+1)$ dimensions,
up to the constant factor $\frac12$.

\paragraph{Sign convention.}
We use $U/E_0= -\tfrac12\,\kappa^2$ and $K/E_0=\tfrac12\,\beta^2$ as \emph{budgets}.
The minus sign attaches to the potential budget by convention of reference (surface vs infinity);
the budgets themselves are positive quadratic measures, while transfer $\Delta E$ is the signed sum
of budget \emph{changes}.

\subsection{Physical Interpretation}

In classical derivations, \eqref{eq:classical_surface} is just the sum
$\Delta U + K$ with a particular choice of potential zero.
In the RG, \eqref{eq:will_minkowski_energy} emerges directly from the
energy--symmetry relation:
\[
\Delta E_{A\to B}
= \frac12\bigl((\kappa_A^2 - \kappa_B^2) + \beta_B^2\bigr),
\]
with $(A,B) = (\text{surface},\ \text{orbit})$,
and is \emph{invariantly} expressible as a difference of squared projections.

This shows that the Keplerian total energy is not an isolated Newtonian
artifact but a special case of a deeper geometric structure. 
While this framework refuse to postulate any spacetime metric in the traditional sense, the emergence of this Minkowski-like structure from purely energetic principles is a powerful indicator of the deep identity between the geometry of spacetime and the geometry of energy transformation. 

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Why This Matters]
\begin{itemize}
\item In classical form, the total orbital energy per unit mass depends only on
$GM$ and $a$, and is independent of the test--mass $m$.
\item In WILL form, the same fact is embedded in a Minkowski--like difference
of squared projections, with no need for separate ``gravitational'' and
``kinetic'' constructs.
\item This re framing answers \emph{why} the Keplerian combination appears:
it is enforced by the underlying geometry of energy transformation.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}


\section{Lagrangian and Hamiltonian as Ontologically Corrupted RG Approximations}
\textit{The following section present philosophical and algebraic 
demonstration: the standard $L$ and $H$ arise as degenerate limits of the relational 
Energy–Symmetry law.}

We now demonstrate that the familiar Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms 
are not fundamental principles but ontologically ``dirty'' approximations of 
the relational WILL framework. By collapsing the \textbf{two-point relational structure }
into a single-point description, classical mechanics gains computational convenience 
at the cost of ontological clarity.

\subsection{Definitions of Parameters}

We consider a central mass $M$ and a test mass $m$. The state of the test 
mass is described in polar coordinates $(r,\phi)$ relative to the central 
mass.

\begin{itemize}
  \item $r_A$ --- reference radius associated with observer $A$ 
  (e.g., planetary surface).
  \item $r_B$ --- orbital radius of the test mass $m$ (position of observer $B$).
  \item $v_B^2 = \dot r_B^2 + r_B^2 \dot\phi^2$ --- total squared orbital speed at $B$.
  \item $\beta_B^2 = v_B^2/c^2$ --- dimensionless kinematic projection at $B$.
  \item $\kappa_A^2 = 2GM/(r_A c^2)$ --- dimensionless potential projection defined at $A$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Relational Lagrangian}

Instead of a relational energy, we define the \emph{clean relational Lagrangian} $L_{\text{rel}}$, which represents the kinetic budget at point $B$ relative to the potential budget at point $A$:
\begin{equation}
L_{\text{rel}} = T(B) - U(A) = \tfrac{1}{2} m\left(\dot r_B^2 + r_B^2 \dot\phi^2\right) - \frac{GMm}{r_A}.
\end{equation}
In dimensionless form, using the rest energy $E_0 = mc^2$, this is:
\begin{equation}
\frac{L_{\text{rel}}}{E_0} = \tfrac{1}{2}\bigl(\beta_B^2 + \kappa_A^2\bigr).
\end{equation}
This two-point, relational form is the clean geometric statement.

\subsection{First Ontological Collapse: The Newtonian Lagrangian}

If one commits the first ontological violation by identifying the two 
distinct points, $r_A = r_B = r$, the relational structure degenerates into a 
local, single-point function:
\begin{equation}
L(r,\dot r,\dot\phi)=\tfrac12 m(\dot r^2+r^2\dot\phi^2)+\frac{GMm}{r}.
\end{equation}
This is precisely the standard Newtonian Lagrangian. Its origin is not fundamental 
but arises from the collapse of the two-point relational Energy Symmetry law into 
a one-point formalism.

\subsection{Second Ontological Collapse: The Hamiltonian}

Introducing canonical momenta,
\begin{align}
p_r &= \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot r} = m\dot r, \\
p_\phi &= \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot\phi} = mr^2\dot\phi,
\end{align}
one defines the Hamiltonian via the Legendre transformation $H = p_r \dot r + p_\phi \dot\phi - L$. This evaluates to the total energy of the collapsed system:
\begin{equation}
H = T+U = \tfrac{1}{2} m\left(\dot r^2 + r^2 \dot\phi^2\right) + \frac{GMm}{r}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Interpretation}

In terms of the collapsed WILL projections ($\beta^2 = v^2/c^2$ and $\kappa^2 = 2GM/(rc^2)$, both strictly positive), the match to standard mechanics becomes explicit:
\begin{align}
L &= \tfrac{1}{2} m v^2 + \frac{GMm}{r}
   \;\;\;\longleftrightarrow\;\;\;
   \tfrac{1}{2} m c^2\bigl(\beta^2 + \kappa^2\bigr), \\[6pt]
H &= \tfrac{1}{2} m v^2 - \frac{GMm}{r}
   \;\;\;\longleftrightarrow\;\;\;
   \tfrac{1}{2} m c^2\bigl(\beta^2 - \kappa^2\bigr).
\end{align}

Here the ``$+$'' or ``$-$'' signs do not come from $\kappa^2$ itself, which is always positive, but from the ontological collapse of the two-point relational energy law into a single-point formalism. In WILL, both projections are clean and positive; in standard mechanics, the apparent sign difference arises only after this collapse.

Both are ontologically ``dirty''  approximations. The clean relational law, 
involving distinct points $A$ and $B$, is collapsed into a local, 
one-point description. This shows that  Hamiltonian and  Lagrangian are just needlessly overcomplicated approximations that  lose in ontological integrity.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Key Message]
The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian are not fundamental principles. They are 
degenerate shadows of a deeper relational Energy Symmetry law. Classical mechanics, 
Special Relativity, and General Relativity all operate within this corrupted 
approximation. WILL restores the underlying two-point relational clarity.
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Legacy Dictionary (for conventional formalisms).}  

Within RG, all physical content is expressed purely in terms of relational projections $\beta$ and $\kappa$ on $S^1$ and $S^2$.

They are computational \emph{shadows}, useful for legacy calculations but physically redundant.

\subsubsection{Third Ontological Collapse: Derivation of Newton's Third Law}

We now demonstrate that Newton's Third Law, like the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian,
is not a fundamental principle but another "degenerate shadow" of the WILL framework.
It arises as a necessary mathematical consequence of the same ontological collapse
--- forcing a two-point relational law into a single-point, instantaneous formalism.

\begin{theorem}[Newton's Third Law as a Degenerate Consequence]
The Energy--Symmetry Law ($\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0$)
mathematically necessitates Newton's Third Law ($\vec{F}_{AB} = - \vec{F}_{BA}$)
in the classical, non-relativistic limit where the two-point relational
energy budget is collapsed into a single-point potential function $U(\vec{r})$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We begin with the foundational Energy--Symmetry Law (Section~\ref{sec:energy-symmetry}), 
the principle of causal balance for state transitions:
\[
\Delta E_{A \to B} + \Delta E_{B \to A} = 0.
\]
In the classical, non-relativistic limit, this two-point relational law is 
"ontologically corrupted" into a single-point potential energy function, $U$.
This function is assumed to depend only on the relative positions of the two 
interacting entities, $A$ and $B$:
\[
U = U(\vec{r}) \quad \text{where} \quad \vec{r} = \vec{r}_B - \vec{r}_A.
\]
This $U(\vec{r})$ is the classical approximation of the system's relational energy budget.
In this collapsed formalism, the force $\vec{F}$ is defined as the negative 
gradient of this potential.

\paragraph{(1) Force on $B$ by $A$ ($\vec{F}_{AB}$):}
This force is found by taking the gradient with respect to $B$'s coordinates:
\begin{align}
\vec{F}_{AB} &= - \nabla_B U(\vec{r}_B - \vec{r}_A) \\
% Use chain rule: dU/dr * dr/dr_B
&= - \left( \frac{d U}{d \vec{r}} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\partial \vec{r}}{\partial \vec{r}_B} \right) \\
&= - \nabla U(\vec{r}) \cdot (\mathbf{I}) \\
&= - \nabla U(\vec{r})
\end{align}

\paragraph{(2) Force on $A$ by $B$ ($\vec{F}_{BA}$):}
This force is found by taking the gradient with respect to $A$'s coordinates:
\begin{align}
\vec{F}_{BA} &= - \nabla_A U(\vec{r}_B - \vec{r}_A) \\
% Use chain rule: dU/dr * dr/dr_A
&= - \left( \frac{d U}{d \vec{r}} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\partial \vec{r}}{\partial \vec{r}_A} \right) \\
&= - \nabla U(\vec{r}) \cdot (-\mathbf{I}) \\
&= + \nabla U(\vec{r})
\end{align}

\paragraph{(3) Conclusion:}
By direct comparison of the results, we find:
\[
\vec{F}_{AB} = - \nabla U(\vec{r}) \quad \text{and} \quad \vec{F}_{BA} = + \nabla U(\vec{r}).
\]
Therefore, it is a mathematical tautology of the collapsed formalism that:
\[
\boxed{ \vec{F}_{AB} = - \vec{F}_{BA} }
\]
This completes the proof. Newton's Third Law is not an independent physical 
axiom, but the built-in mathematical consequence of approximating the 
Energy Symmetry Law with a single potential function. 
The law of "equal and opposite forces" is revealed to be a degenerate 
approximation of the more fundamental, generative law of 
Relational Geometry.
 \end{proof}



\subsection{General Consequence}
Bad philosophy, in RG sense, has three measurable effects:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Inflated Formalism: Equations multiply to compensate for ontological error.
    \item Loss of Transparency: Physical meaning becomes hidden behind coordinate dependencies.
    \item Empirical Fragmentation: Each domain (cosmology, quantum, gravitation) requires separate constants.
\end{enumerate}

By contrast, good philosophy—\textbf{epistemic hygiene}—enforces relational closure and yields simplicity through necessity, not through approximation.

In short:

\[​
\boxed{\text{\textbf{Bad philosophy creates complexity \,  Good philosophy reveals geometry.}}}
\]

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Daring Remark]
The historical escalation of mathematical complexity in physics 
did not reveal deeper reality - it compensated for a philosophical mistake.
Once the ontological symmetry is restored, 
Nature’s laws reduce to algebraic self-consistency.  
\[
\boxed{\text{Bad Philosophy}} \Rightarrow \boxed{\text{Ontological Duplication}} \Rightarrow \boxed{\text{Mathematical Inflation}} 
\]
\[
\boxed{\text{\textbf{Complex mathematics is the consequence of bad philosophy.}}}
\]
\end{tcolorbox}


\section{Rotational Systems (Kerr Without Metric)}

\subsection{Contextual Bounds}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{For a gravitationally closed (static) system,} the physical boundary is defined by the condition $\kappa^2 = 1$. The closure principle ($\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$) is what dictates that this corresponds to a kinetic state of $\beta^2 = 1/2$.
    \item \textbf{For a kinematically closed (maximally rotating) system,} the physical boundary is defined by the condition $\beta^2 = 1$. The same closure principle ($\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$) then necessitates that the corresponding gravitational state must be $\kappa^2 = 2$.
\end{itemize}

For rotating black holes, we establish the connection between relational kinetic projection and the Kerr metric by defining:

\[
\beta =\frac{a c^2}{G m_0}, \quad \kappa = \sqrt{2} \beta
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(\beta\) is the relational rotation parameter, with \(0 \leq \beta \leq 1\),
    \item \(\kappa\) is related to the geometry and gravity,
    \item \(R_s = \frac{2 G m_0}{c^2}\) is the Schwarzschild radius,
    \item \(a = \frac{J}{m_0 c}\) is the Kerr rotation parameter,
    \item \(J\) is the angular momentum of the black hole,
    \item \(m_0\) is the mass of the black hole.
\end{itemize}

We also derive a key invariant relationship:

\[
a_{\max} = \frac{G m_0}{c^2} = \frac{R_s}{2} =\beta_{\max}^2  r
\]

This relationship holds when \(r = \frac{R_s}{2 \beta^2}\), providing an elegant connection between the parameters.

\subsection{Event Horizon}
Using our approach, the inner and outer event horizons of the Kerr metric are expressed as:

\[
r_{\pm} = \frac{R_s}{2} \left(1 \pm {\beta_Y}\right)
\]

For the extreme case where \(\beta = 1\) (maximal rotation), the horizons merge at:

\[
r_{+} = r_{-} = \frac{R_s}{2}
\]

This coincides with the minimum radius in our model predicted using maximum value of $\kappa$ parameter $\kappa_{max}=\sqrt{2}$:

\[
r_{\min} = \frac{1}{\kappa_{max}^2} R_s = \frac{1}{2} R_s
\]

\subsection{Ergosphere}
The radius of the ergosphere in our model is described as:

\[
r_{\text{ergo}} = \frac{R_s}{2} \left(1 + \sqrt{1 - \beta^2 \cos^2 \theta}\right)
\]

This formulation correctly reproduces the key features of the ergosphere:
\begin{itemize}
    \item At the equator (\(\theta = \pi / 2\)), \(r_{\text{ergo}} = R_s\) for any rotation parameter,
    \item At the poles (\(\theta = 0\)), \(r_{\text{ergo}}\) coincides with the event horizon radius.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ring Singularity}
Unlike the Schwarzschild metric with its point singularity, the Kerr metric features a ring singularity located at:
\[
r = 0, \quad \theta = \frac{\pi}{2}
\]
The "size" of this ring is proportional to \(a = \frac{G m_0}{c^2} \beta\), reaching its maximum for extreme black holes (\(\beta = 1\)).

\subsection{Naked Singularity}
For \(\beta \leq 1\), a naked singularity does not emerge, aligning with the cosmic censorship Principle. In our model, Energy Symmetry Law enforce constraint by limiting \(\beta\) to the range \([0, 1]\).

\subsection{The Relationship Between \(\kappa > 1\) and Rotation}
For extreme rotation (\(\beta = 1\)), we find \(\kappa = \sqrt{2} > 1\), which reflects the displacement of the event horizon and the geometric properties of rotating black holes. This suggests that values of \(\kappa > 1\) are inherently connected to the physics of rotation in spacetime.

This connection suggests that the rotation of a black hole can be understood through geometric parameters analogous to orbital mechanics. Physically, it indicates that the rotational properties of the black hole, encapsulated in \(a_*\), mirror the orbital velocity parameter \(\beta\), providing a unified description of spacetime dynamics.

\textbf{Philosophically}, this reinforces the notion that gravitational phenomena, including rotation, are manifestations of the underlying geometry of the universe. The absence of additional "material" parameters underscores the elegance of general relativity, where the curvature of spacetime alone dictates the behavior of massive rotating objects. This geometric interpretation bridges the gap between the abstract mathematics of the Kerr metric and the intuitive physics of orbital motion, offering a deeper insight into the nature of spacetime.

\subsection*{Physical Interpretation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{No need for pre-existing spacetime} — geometry emerges from angular energy distributions.
  \item \textbf{All parameters} are dimensionless and directly derived from the speed of light as finite resource.
  \item \textbf{Scale invariance:} The same structure applies from Planck-scale objects to galactic black holes.
\end{itemize}


\section{$W_{\text{ILL}}$ — Unity of Relational Structure}
\label{sec:willinvariant}

From the geometric closure of WILL we derive the universal invariant connecting mass, energy, time, and length.  
Each is a projection of the same relational whole:

\begin{align}
M &= \frac{\beta^2}{\beta_Y}\,c^2\,\frac{r}{G}, \\[4pt]
E &= \frac{\kappa^2}{\kappa_X}\,\frac{c^4 r}{2G}, \\[4pt]
T &= \kappa_X\left(\frac{2Gm_0}{\kappa^2 c^3}\right)^2, \\[4pt]
L &= \beta_Y\left(\frac{Gm_0}{\beta^2 c^2}\right)^2.
\end{align}

Combining these projections yields the universal dimensionless invariant:
\[
\boxed{
W_{\text{ILL}}
= \frac{E \, T}{M \, L}
= \frac{\frac{E_0}{\kappa_X}\,\kappa_X t^2}{\frac{m_0}{\beta_Y}\,\beta_Y r^2}
= 1.
}
\]

All dimensional constants and parameters cancel identically.
This equality is not a result of unit choice, but the manifestation of structural closure:
\[
\boxed{\textbf{WILL} = 1.}
\]

\subsection{Interpretive Note: The Name "WILL"}

The term \textbf{WILL} stands for \textbf{SPACE–TIME–ENERGY}.  
It is both a formal shorthand and a philosophical statement:  
the universe is not a stage where energy acts through time upon space,  
but a single self-balancing structure whose internal distinctions generate all phenomena.  
The name also serves as a gentle irony toward anthropic thinking:  
the cosmos does not possess “will” - yet through WILL, it manifests all that is.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary]
\[
\boxed{
\textbf{WILL} \;\equiv\;
\frac{E T}{ML} = 1
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\text{Geometry = Energy = Causality.}
} 
\]
\[
\boxed{
\textbf{It is not the unit of something - it is the unity of everything.}
}
\]
\end{tcolorbox}
 

\section{Beyond Differential Formalism: Structural Dynamics}

\subsection{Intrinsic Dynamics via Energy Redistribution}

In Relational Geometry (RG), dynamics is not the evolution of quantities \textit{in} time, but the continuous re-balancing of a closed network of algebraic relations.  
What appears as "motion" or "change" is the ordered succession of states satisfying all projectional constraints.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!40!black,title=Summary]
\textbf{Time does not drive change — change defines time.}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Why There Are No Equations of Motion}

Classical physics describes systems through differential evolution:
\[
\delta S = 0, \qquad S = \int L\,dt,
\]
assuming an independent temporal parameter and a variational freedom over possible trajectories.  
In RG, none of these assumptions hold:
\begin{itemize}
\item There is no continuum of possible paths.
\item There is no freedom to vary.
\item The system itself defines temporal order.
\end{itemize}

Each observable is locked into a closed web of relational equations.  
A valid state is one—and only one—where all constraints are simultaneously satisfied.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=One valid configuration]
There is only one physically meaningful configuration at any moment:  
the one where all relational projections close exactly.  
Everything else is not forbidden—it simply does not exist.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Why the Metric Is Physically Meaningless}

The metric tensor \(g_{\mu\nu}\) presupposes an external backdrop on which events are placed.  
In RG there is no such background: distance and duration are nothing but relational measures between energy states.  
The relations \((\beta,\kappa)\) already encode all observable structure.  
Introducing a metric would merely restate these relations redundantly in coordinate form.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Summary]
In RG there is no metric, no Lagrangian, no equations of motion.  
There is only a closed algebraic structure of energetic relations.  
Its self-consistency defines both geometry and causality.
\end{tcolorbox}



\section{Derivation of Density, Mass, and Pressure}

\subsection{Geometric Foundation}
From the projective analysis established in the previous sections, the fundamental invariant is
\[
\kappa^2 = \frac{R_s}{r},
\]
where $\kappa$ emerges from the energy projection on the area of unit sphere $S^2$, and $R_s = 2Gm_0/c^2$ links to the mass scale factor $m_0 = E_0/c^2$.

\subsection{Derivation of Energy Density}

\paragraph{From Mass Scale to Volumetric Potential.}
Starting from the geometric relation,
\[
m_0 = \frac{\kappa^2 c^2 r}{2G},
\]
we associate $m_0$ with a volumetric proxy $r^3$, obtaining a raw volumetric potential,
\[
\frac{m_0}{r^3} = \frac{\kappa^2 c^2}{2G r^2}.
\]

\paragraph{Applying the Geometric Distribution Principle.}
Because the potential projection $\kappa$ is distributed over S2  -  a 2D spherical manifold, the volumetric expression must be normalized over the unit-sphere area $4\pi$. This yields the physical energy density,
\[
\rho = \frac{1}{4\pi}\left(\frac{\kappa^2 c^2}{2G r^2}\right) 
.
\]
\[
\rho = \frac{\kappa^2c^2}{8\pi G r^2}.
\]
$$\text{Local Energy Density} \equiv \text{Relational Projection}$$

\paragraph{Maximal Density.}
At $\kappa^2 = R_s/r = 1$, the horizon condition is reached, corresponding to the maximal observable energy density at radius $r=R_s$:
\[
\rho_{\max} = \frac{c^2}{8\pi G r^2}.
\]
\paragraph{Normalized Relation.}
Thus the fundamental identification is
\[
\boxed{\;\kappa^2 = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{\max}} \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; \kappa^2 \equiv \Omega\;}.
\]

\subsection{Self-Consistency Requirement}

The mass scale factor can be expressed in two equivalent ways.

From the geometric definition:
\[
m_0 = \frac{\kappa^2 c^2 r}{2G}.
\]

From the energy density:
\[
m_0 = \alpha \, r^n \, \rho.
\]

Substituting $\rho = \frac{\kappa^2 c^2}{8\pi G r^2}$ into $m_0 = \alpha \, r^n \, \rho$ gives
\[
m_0 = \frac{\alpha \kappa^2 c^2 r^{n-2}}{8\pi G}.
\]

Equating the two forms:
\[
\frac{\alpha r^{n-2}}{8\pi} = \frac{r}{2}.
\]

Radius independence requires $n=3$, yielding $\alpha=4\pi$. Hence,
\[
m_0 = 4\pi r^3 \rho,
\]
which closes the consistency loop between the geometric and density-based formulations.

\subsection{Pressure as Surface Curvature Gradient}

In the RG framework pressure is not a thermodynamic assumption but the direct consequence of curvature gradients.  
The radial balance relation gives
\[
P(r) \;=\; \frac{c^4}{8\pi G}\,\frac{1}{r}\,\frac{d\kappa^2}{dr}.
\]

Using $\kappa^2 = R_s/r$, one finds $d\kappa^2/dr = -\kappa^2/r$, hence
\[
P(r) \;=\; -\,\frac{\kappa^2 c^4}{8\pi G r^2}.
\]

Since the local energy density is
\[
\rho(r) \;=\; \frac{\kappa^2 c^2}{8\pi G r^2},
\]
this yields the invariant equation of state
\[
\boxed{\,P(r) = -\,\rho(r)\,c^2\,}.
\]

\paragraph{Interpretation.}
$P$ is a surface-like negative pressure (isotropic tension), not a bulk volume pressure.  
It expresses the resistance of energy–geometry itself to changes in projection.  

\paragraph{Consistency.}
If one formally freezes the projection parameter ($d\kappa^2/dr=0$), then $P=0$.  
But in this case the angular curvature terms remain uncompensated, and the field equation is no longer satisfied.  
Any nontrivial radial dependence of $\kappa$ inevitably generates the negative tension 
\[
P = -\rho c^2,
\]
which precisely cancels the residual curvature.  
Thus the negative pressure is not optional but a necessary ingredient for full self-consistency.

\paragraph{Maximum pressure.}
At the geometric bound $\kappa^2=1$ (horizon condition), the density saturates at
\[
\rho_{\max} = \frac{c^2}{8\pi G r^2},
\]
and the corresponding pressure is
\[
P_{\max} = -\,\rho_{\max}\,c^2 \;=\; -\,\frac{c^4}{8\pi G r^2}.
\]
This negative surface pressure represents the ultimate tension limit of spacetime fabric at a given scale $r$.


Pressure in WILL is the intrinsic surface tension of energy–geometry, saturating at $P_{\max}=-c^4/(8\pi G r^2)$.

\section{Local Cosmological Term in RG}

\begin{lemma}[Normalization Identity]
In WILL Relational Geometry, local energy density and its maximal counterpart are related by
\begin{align}
\rho(r) &= \frac{\kappa^{2} c^{2}}{8\pi G r^{2}}, \\
\rho_{\max}(r) &= \frac{c^{2}}{8\pi G r^{2}}, \\
\Rightarrow\quad \boxed{\kappa^{2} = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{\max}}}. 
\end{align}
This ratio defines the dimensionless geometric projection parameter $\kappa^{2}$ as a normalized energy measure.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[Geometric Field Equation]
For a static, spherically symmetric configuration, the unified field equation of WILL RG reads
\begin{equation}
\boxed{
\frac{d}{dr}\!\left(r\,\kappa^{2}\right) = \frac{8\pi G}{c^{2}}\, r^{2}\rho(r)
}.
\label{eq:will_field}
\end{equation}
This expression reproduces the $tt$–component of the Einstein field equations inside a spherical mass distribution when written in terms of the areal radius $r$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Starting from the standard Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff (TOV) form,
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{r^{2}}\frac{d}{dr}\!\left[r\!\left(1-\frac{1}{g_{rr}}\right)\right] = \frac{8\pi G}{c^{2}}\rho(r),
\end{equation}
and defining
\(
\kappa^{2}(r) \equiv 1 - \frac{1}{g_{rr}} = \frac{2Gm(r)}{rc^{2}},
\)
one obtains Eq.~\eqref{eq:will_field} directly. 
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Vacuum Stress Tensor]
Let the intrinsic geometric normalization $\rho_{\max}(r)$ act as a vacuum background of isotropic tension:
\begin{equation}
T^{(\mathrm{vac})}_{\mu\nu} \;=\; -\,\rho_{\max}(r)\,c^{2}\, g_{\mu\nu}.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}[Emergent Cosmological Term]
Substituting $T^{(\mathrm{vac})}_{\mu\nu}$ into Einstein’s equation
\[
G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}} T_{\mu\nu},
\]
yields an \emph{effective} local cosmological term
\begin{align}
\Lambda(r) 
  &= \frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}}\rho_{\max}(r)c^{2}
   = \frac{8\pi G}{c^{2}}\rho_{\max}(r)
   = \frac{1}{r^{2}}.
\end{align}
Hence the cosmological contribution is not postulated but arises algebraically from the normalization of relational energy.
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}[Equation of State and Vacuum Equivalence]
From the radial curvature balance,
\begin{equation}
P(r) = \frac{c^{4}}{8\pi G}\frac{1}{r}\frac{d\kappa^{2}}{dr},
\end{equation}
and using $\kappa^{2}=R_{s}/r$, one finds
\begin{equation}
P(r) = -\,\rho(r)\,c^{2}.
\end{equation}
Therefore the built-in equation of state of Relational Geometry exactly matches that of the cosmological vacuum, confirming the identification
\[
P_{\Lambda} = -\,\rho_{\Lambda}c^{2}, \qquad \rho_{\Lambda} \equiv \rho_{\max}, \qquad \Lambda(r) = \frac{8\pi G}{c^{2}}\rho_{\Lambda}(r) = \frac{1}{r^{2}}.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!80!black,title=Summary]
In RG, the cosmological constant emerges naturally from the geometric normalization of energy density:
\[
\boxed{\Lambda(r) = \dfrac{1}{r^{2}}.}
\]
Thus the vacuum energy of GR corresponds to the intrinsic curvature limit of relational geometry itself.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Unified Geometric Field Equation}

\subsection{The Theoretical Ouroboros}
From the energy-geometry equivalence, the complete description of gravitational phenomena reduces to a single algebraic relation:

\begin{equation}
\boxed{
\kappa^2 = \frac{R_s}{r} = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{max}}
}
\label{eq:unified_field}
\end{equation}
                                        \textbf{The ratio of geometric scales equals the ratio of energy densities.}\\

This is the unified geometric field equation of WILL Relational Geometry. It expresses the complete equivalence:
\[
\text{SPACETIME GEOMETRY} \equiv \text{ENERGY DISTRIBUTION}
\]
We have shown that this single foundational Principle, through pure geometric reasoning, necessarily leads to an equation which mathematically expresses the very same equivalence we began with. We started with a single foundational  Principle \(\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY}\), from which geometry and physical laws are logically derived, and these derived laws then loop back to intrinsically define and limit the very nature of energy and spacetime, proving the self-consistency of the initial idea.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
 \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{IMAGES/1_WILL-Relational-Geometry}
The foundational  Principle \(\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY}\) closes into the unified field equation
\[
\kappa^2 = \frac{R_s}{r} = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{\max}},
\]
\end{figure}


\begin{quote}
Theoretical Ouroboros

The RG framework exhibits perfect logical closure: the fundamental Principle about the nature of spacetime and energy is proven as the inevitable consequence of geometric consistency.

\end{quote}

  From a philosophical and epistemological point of view, this can be considered the crown achievement of any theoretical framework — the “Theoretical Ouroboros”. But regardless of  aesthetic beauty of this result let’s remain sceptical.

\subsection{No Singularities, No Hidden Regions}

This framework introduces no interior singularities, no coordinate patches hidden behind horizons, and no ambiguous initial conditions. The geometric field equation:

\[
\frac{R_{s}}{r}=\frac{8\pi G}{c^{2}}r^{2}\ \rho=\kappa^{2}
\]
ensures that curvature and energy density evolve smoothly and remain bounded across all observable scales.

WILL Relational Geometry resolves the singularity problem not by regularizing divergent terms, nor by introducing quantum effects, but by geometrically constraining the domain of valid projections. Curvature is always finite, and energy remains bounded by construction. Black holes become energetically saturated but nonsingular regions, described entirely by finite, dimensionless parameters.

This projectional approach provides a clean, intrinsic termination to gravitational collapse, replacing singular endpoints with structured, maximally curved boundaries.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Surface–scaled closure (vs.\ volume filling).} 
Mass follows the algebraic closure $m_0=4\pi r^3\rho$ with $\rho=\kappa^2 c^2/(8\pi G r^2)$; the $4\pi$ is the spherical projection measure, not a Newtonian volume average.
\item \textbf{Natural bounds.}
The constraint for non rotating systems $\kappa^2\le 1$ enforces $\rho\le\rho_{\max}$ and $|P|\le |P_{\max}|=c^4/(8\pi G r^2)$, avoiding singularities without extra hypotheses.
\end{itemize}


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!4, colframe=black!70!black, title=Summary]
The WILL framework postulates no external laws or assumptions.
All physical structure emerges from the single relational equivalence:

\[
\boxed{\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY}}
\]

From this, by enforcing geometric self-consistency, one necessarily arrives at
the Unified Geometric Field Equation:

\[
\boxed{\kappa^2 = \frac{R_s}{r} = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{\max}}.}
\]

This is not an external law but an intrinsic closure relation: 
geometry and energy are two mutually defining projections of a single entity.
It represents the completion of the theoretical Ouroboros --- 
where the principle generates its own mathematical expression and 
the expression in turn validates the principle.
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{\textbf{Algebraic Closure and Structural Dynamics}}

Physical dynamics in WILL Relational Geometry (RG) emerges not from
temporal evolution equations but from a set of algebraically closed invariants.
Each parameter participates in a self–consistent configuration of relational constraints.
Changing any one parameter necessitates a coordinated shift in all others to maintain validity.

\begin{definition}[Algebraic Closure of the WILL Structure]
The minimal algebraic closure of the RG system is expressed by the set:
\[
\begin{cases}
\kappa^2 = 2 \beta^2, \\[4pt]
R_s = \dfrac{2G m_0}{c^2}, \\[4pt]
r = \dfrac{R_s}{\kappa^2}, \\[4pt]
\rho = \dfrac{\kappa^2 c^2}{8\pi G r^2}, \\[4pt]
\rho_{\max} = \dfrac{c^2}{8\pi G r^2}, \\[4pt]
t = \dfrac{r}{c}, \\[4pt]
m_0 = 4\pi r^3 \rho.
\end{cases}
\]
These relations are not independent definitions but mutual constraints.
Each variable acquires meaning only within the self-consistent closure of the entire system.
\end{definition}


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!40!black,title=No differential equations are required:]
 \textbf{Dynamics unfolds as a consequence of relational energy transformations.}
\end{tcolorbox}


\begin{lemma}[Causal Closure without Circularity]
Every observable quantity in RG can be determined from a minimal input pair
composed of one dynamic projection (e.g.\ $\kappa$ or $\beta$) and one scale parameter
(e.g.\ $r$, $M$, or $\rho$).  
No parameter both defines and is defined by the same input.
Thus, the system avoids circularity while remaining causally closed.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[Structural Dynamics]
Within the closed algebraic configuration
\((\kappa,\beta,\rho,r,t)\),
any local variation of one parameter entails a coherent transformation of all others,
such that the algebraic closure is preserved:
\[
\delta\Phi(\kappa,\beta,\rho,r,t)=0,
\qquad
\Phi \text{ representing the constraint manifold.}
\]
Therefore, dynamics is the propagation of constraint consistency rather than temporal evolution.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}[Emergent Time]
Since every admissible configuration is defined by its energy–geometry relations,
the parameter conventionally called “time’’ is nothing more than an ordered index of transitions
between self-consistent configurations:
\[
\boxed{\text{Time} \equiv \text{Change in }(\kappa, \beta, \rho, r,\ldots)}.
\]
Thus, causality in RG is structural, not temporal; 
it refers to coherence of relations rather than to sequences of events.
\end{corollary}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!40!black,title=Interpretation]
\textbf{Dynamics without Differentials:}  
In RG, no differential equations of motion are required.  
Physical change is expressed through algebraic redistribution of geometric and energetic quantities.  
Time is emergent, coherence is enforced, and the universe evolves 
as a continuous sequence of balanced configurations.
\[
\boxed{\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY}}
\]
\end{tcolorbox}

The result is a structure where \textbf{causality is internal}, \textbf{coherence is enforced},  
and \textbf{dynamics is simply the shifting of balanced configurations} ---  
not the unfolding of arbitrary functions over time.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5, colframe=black!80!black, title=Philosophical Closure]
The entire relational structure can be read as a self-consistent equation of existence:
\[
\boxed{\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY} \;\Longleftrightarrow\; W_{\text{ILL}} = 1.}
\]
Geometry, density, motion, and causality are not separate domains but 
inter-translations within one algebraic identity.
The universe is not governed by differential laws — it \emph{is} their solution.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Numerical Example: Accretion onto a Black Hole}

Consider a black hole accreting mass from a surrounding disk to illustrate the model's intrinsic dynamics. Let the initial mass be $m_0 = 10 , M_\odot$, with a Schwarzschild radius $R_s = \frac{2 G m_0}{c^2} \approx 2.95 \times 10^4 , \text{m}$. Suppose $\kappa = 0.1$, so $r = \frac{R_s}{\kappa^2} = \frac{2.95 \times 10^4}{0.01} = 2.95 \times 10^6 , \text{m}$, and the associated time scale is $t = \frac{r}{c} \approx 9.83 \times 10^{-3} , \text{s}$.

As the black hole accretes mass, increasing to $m_1 = 10.1 , M_\odot$, the Schwarzschild radius becomes $R_s \approx 2.98 \times 10^4 , \text{m}$. Assuming $\kappa$ remains constant for simplicity, $r = \frac{2.98 \times 10^4}{0.01} = 2.98 \times 10^6 , \text{m}$, and $t \approx 9.93 \times 10^{-3} , \text{s}$. This increase in $t$ reflects the system's evolution, driven solely by the changing geometry.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!4,colframe=black!80!black,title=Summary]
In Relational Geometry, causality is not temporal but structural.
Each variable $(\kappa, \beta, \rho, r, t)$ participates in an algebraically closed configuration 
that defines a self-consistent physical state. 
Any local variation of one variable entails a coherent transformation of all others, 
preserving the closure of the system. 
Hence, \emph{dynamics} is the propagation of constraint consistency, 
and \emph{time} is the ordered index of these transformations.
\[
\boxed{\text{Time} \equiv \text{Change in }(\kappa, \beta, \rho, r, ...)}
\]
\end{tcolorbox}

\section*{Ontological Shift: From Descriptive to Generative Physics}
\label{Generative Physics}
In conventional physics the methodology follows a descriptive paradigm:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Observable phenomena are identified.  
    \item Empirical regularities are codified as ``laws of nature.''  
    \item Mathematical formalisms are constructed to \emph{describe} these regularities.  
\end{enumerate}

Thus, physical laws are always introduced as external assumptions that model what is seen.  
Even in General Relativity, where geometry plays the central role, the equivalence principle and the metric postulate are still external inputs.

The RG framework inverts this paradigm. Laws are not added on top of observations;  
they are \emph{generated} as inevitable consequences of relational geometry:
\begin{itemize}
    \item There are no independent axioms such as ``inertial mass equals gravitational mass.''  
    \item Such relations appear automatically as algebraic identities enforced by the geometry.  
    \item What classical physics calls ``laws of nature'' are secondary shadows of the single relational principle:
    \[
       \text{SPACETIME} \;\equiv\; \text{ENERGY}.
    \]
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!70!black,title=Key Distinction]
\textbf{Standard Physics:} Laws \emph{describe} what we observe. \\
\textbf{RG Framework:} Laws are \emph{generated} as necessary products of relational geometry.
\end{tcolorbox}

\noindent
In this sense, the ontological role of physical law is transformed.  
Physics ceases to be a catalog of empirical descriptions, and becomes the logical unfolding of a single relational structure.  
WILL identifies the necessary conditions under which all observed phenomena arise.

\section{Axiomatic Foundations Theorem:WILL Relational Geometry (RG) and General Relativity (GR)}
\begin{quote}
“This logical asymmetry does not imply physical superiority a priori; it only states that any empirical support for GR already presupposes relational invariance.” 
\end{quote}

\begin{definition}[GR Core Axioms]
General Relativity (GR) is assumed to rest on the following axioms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(A1)] The spacetime arena is a smooth Lorentzian manifold with metric $g_{\mu\nu}$.
    \item[(A2)] Diffeomorphism invariance (general covariance): the form of physical laws is independent of coordinates.
    \item[(A3)] Local Lorentz invariance / Einstein equivalence principle: locally, spacetime is Minkowskian.
    \item[(A4)] Einstein Field Equations (EFE): $G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[RG One Principle]
RG is based on a single Principle:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(W1)] \textbf{Relational Principle:} All physical magnitudes are defined purely by relations between entities; spacetime is equivalent to energy.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Relationality in GR]
From A2 and A3 it follows that observable quantities in GR are coordinate-independent
and must be expressed relationally. In particular, no absolute magnitudes can serve
as observables.
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}[Bridge: From Relational Principle to GR Axioms]
If the Relational Principle (W1) were false, then physical magnitudes
could in principle be defined in absolute, non-relational terms. 
Such absolutes would provide a hidden external reference structure.
But this contradicts the core of GR:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It violates diffeomorphism invariance (A2), since coordinate independence
    presupposes that only relational quantities are observable.
    \item It undermines the equivalence principle (A3), since local Minkowski structure 
    relies on the impossibility of distinguishing absolute magnitudes from relative ones.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, the negation of W1 directly negates A2 and A3. 
This establishes the logical dependency required for the asymmetry theorem below.
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}[Asymmetric Falsifiability of GR and RG]
\label{thm:asymmetry}
Let $\mathsf{GR}$ denote the theory defined by axioms (A1)--(A4),
and let $\mathsf{RG}$ denote the theory defined by Principle (W1).
Then:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If (W1) is empirically falsified, then (A2)--(A3) are also falsified. 
    Hence, $\mathsf{GR}$ is necessarily falsified.
    \item If any of (A1)--(A3) are empirically falsified, $\mathsf{GR}$ collapses,
    but (W1) may still remain valid as a stand-alone principle.
\end{enumerate}
Therefore, there exist possible empirical scenarios in which GR fails
while RG survives, but there exist no scenarios in which RG fails
while GR survives.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
RG is axiomatically more fundamental than GR: 
its sole Principle (W1) is logically included within the core axioms of GR, 
while GR requires additional ontological structures 
(metric geometry, equivalence principle, Einstein equations) that are 
not necessary for the consistency of RG.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
  \item If \textbf{W1} is empirically falsified, GR's core (A2--A3) is undermined; thus GR is falsified.
  \item If any of \textbf{A1--A3} is falsified, GR collapses, while \textbf{W1} (and thus RG) may still hold.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!4,colframe=black!70!black,title=\textbf{Status of General Relativity within RG}]
It is important to emphasize that the RG framework does not \emph{invalidate} the achievements of General Relativity. 
Rather, it \emph{explains them}. All celebrated predictions of GR --- 
gravitational lensing, perihelion precession, photon spheres, ISCO, horizons --- 
emerge in Relation Geometry as direct consequences of the single closure relation 
$\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$. 

Thus, GR is not a rival but a \textbf{specialized, parameter-heavy realization} of 
RG's more general principle. In logical terms: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Relational Geometry can stand without GR, but GR cannot stand without the relational Principle (W1). 
    \item The empirical successes of GR are preserved within RG, but its pathologies 
    (singularities, dependence on dark entities, ambiguous notion of rest) are avoided. 
\end{itemize}

Therefore, GR should be understood as an \textbf{effective approximation} embedded in 
a deeper relational framework. This perspective retains full respect for the historical 
and observational triumphs of Einstein's theory, while at the same time recognizing its 
status as a non-fundamental limit of a more parsimonious principle.

\subsection{Asymmetric Generality}
The correspondence between these frameworks is fundamentally asymmetric. General Relativity, with its reliance on a pre-supposed metric tensor and the formalism of differential geometry, can be viewed as a specific, parameter-heavy instance of the RG's principles. One can derive GR by adding these additional structures to RG's minimalist foundation. Therefore, the choice between them is not one of preference, but of logical generality and parsimony, where RG provides the logical foundation upon which GR can be consistently constructed. 

\subsection{Epistemological Role of General Relativity}

General Relativity occupies a unique historical position.  
It is the first theory to recognize geometry as the carrier of energy, yet it stops one step short of full equivalence.  
By treating the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ as an independent entity that \emph{responds} to energy--momentum, GR still separates cause and effect.  
In WILL Relational Geometry this distinction dissolves: geometry \emph{is} energy, not its consequence.  

Thus, GR should be seen as the transitional language between the descriptive physics of the nineteenth century and the generative physics of the twenty-first.  
It already encodes the relational structure implicitly, but expresses it through redundant coordinates and differential machinery.  
RG reveals the algebraic heart of GR stripped of these redundancies:
\[
\boxed{G_{\mu\nu} \;\Leftrightarrow\; \kappa^{2}}, \qquad 
\boxed{T_{\mu\nu} \;\Leftrightarrow\; \rho}.
\]
The celebrated field equations of Einstein then reduce to the unified geometric identity
\[
\boxed{\kappa^{2} = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{\max}} = \frac{R_{s}}{r}},
\]
which is the simplest, most symmetric realization of the same principle that GR only encodes indirectly.

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=gray!5,colframe=black!80!black,title=Historical Function of GR]
General Relativity is not wrong — it is \emph{prematurely general}.  
It describes through differentials what WILL generates through relations.  
It built the bridge; WILL walks across it.
\end{tcolorbox}


\section{Conclusion}

 WILL Relational Geometry fully reproduces the predictive content and central equations of both Special and General Relativity, while simultaneously addressing their foundational inconsistencies: 
 \begin{itemize}
     \item (1) the lack of an operational definition of local gravitational energy density in GR, 
     \item (2) the artificial separation of kinetic and gravitational energy in SR and GR, and 
     \item (3) the emergence of singularities as pathological artifacts of coordinate-based models. By treating energy and its transformations as the true basis of geometry, RG unifies and extends these frameworks into a fully relational and operationally grounded description of spacetime and energy.
 \end{itemize}

By focusing on the projectional nature of energy, we have shown that spacetime itself is merely the manifestation of energy.

From a single foundational Principle—that spacetime is equivalent to energy—we derived all the mathematical apparatus needed to describe gravitational and relativistic phenomena. This unification, showing that energy, time, space, and mass are merely different projections of the same underlying structure.
\[
\boxed{\text{Special and General Relativity emerge from the same geometric principles.}}
\]
This approach offers distinct advantages:
\begin{itemize}
\item Conceptual clarity — understanding physics through pure geometry
\item Computational efficiency — significantly reducing complexity 
\item Epistemological hygiene — deriving results from minimal assumptions
\item Philosophical depth — redefining our understanding of time, mass, and causality
\end{itemize}

WILL Relational Geometry inverts our fundamental understanding: 

$$\boxed{\text{Spacetime and energy are mutually defining aspects of a single relational structure.}}$$
