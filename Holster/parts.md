    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
       relational rediscovery of GR and SR from the SPACETIME $\equiv$ ENERGY  principle, yielding a singularity-free, algebraically simple formalism that matches empirical data without dark components. This principle derived by removing the hidden ontological assumption, implicit in modern physics, that structure (spacetime) and dynamics (energy) are separate phenomena (\ref{lem:false-separation}). 

Applying extreme methodological constraints it establishes \textit{Relational Geometry (RG)}: a foundational framework where spacetime is an emergent property of relational energy transformations. This shift establishes an ontological transition from \textit{descriptive} to \textit{generative} physics: instead of introducing laws to model observations, it derives them as necessary consequences of RG itself - turning physics from a catalogue of phenomena into the logical unfolding of inevitable geometrical constrains on closed relational carriers $S^1$ (directional) and $S^2$ (omnidirectional).

 Without metrics, tensors, or free parameters, it reproduces Lorentz factors, the energy-momentum relation, Schwarzschild and Einstein field equations via the dimensionless projections $\beta$ (kinematic) and $\kappa$ (potential). All known GR critical surfaces (photon sphere, ISCO, horizons) emerge as simple fractions of $(\kappa,\beta)$ from the single closure law $\kappa^2=2\beta^2$ (topologically derived, virial-like (Theorem: Closure).  All results are empirically validated and listed in (Appendix I).

\textbf{\textit{WILL Part~I} offers solutions to several long-standing problems, including:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Resolution of GR singularities (via naturally bounded $\rho_{\max}=\frac{c^{2}}{8\pi G r^{2}}$), 
    \item Derivation of the equality of gravitational and inertial masses (from the common channel of rest-invariant scaling) \ref{thm:equivalence}, 
    \item Removal of local energy ambiguity $\rho=\frac{\kappa^{2}c^{2}}{8\pi G r^{2}}$  
    \item Revelation of a clear relational symmetry between kinematic and potential projections,
    \item Developed closed system of equations for Relational Orbital Mechanics (ROM) without G, mass and differential formalism.
    \item Establishment of a computationally simpler and ontologically consistent foundation for subsequent papers on cosmology (Part~II) and quantum mechanics (Part~III).

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
        we apply the principles of WILL Relational Geometry (RG) to the domain of cosmology and galactic dynamics. By strictly enforcing geometric closure conditions with zero free parameters, we establish a sequential unbroken chain of derivations from first principles to observational evidence:
     \item \textbf{Hubble parameter: }we derive ($H_0 \approx 68.15$ km/s/Mpc) solely from the CMB temperature and the fine-structure constant ($\alpha$) providing the direct bridge between scales and landing within 1\% of Planck 2018 mission measurement ($H_0 \approx 67.4$ km/s/Mpc).

     \item \textbf{Distant Supernova Flux Levels:}  using this $H_0$ value along with kinetic and potential geometric weights we compare the curve with \textbf{Pantheon+} dataset - deviations remains below 0.015 mag across the entire redshift range.

     \item  \textbf{CMB Acoustic Spectrum:}  utilizing same derived horizon scale, we reconstruct the CMB acoustic spectrum as the resonant harmonics of an $S^2$ topology loaded by $\approx 4.2\%$ baryons, naturally resolving the "Low Quadrupole" anomaly via vacuum stiffness.

     \item \textbf{Galactic Rotation Curves:} we translate the global horizon into a local acceleration scale ($a_{\kappa} = cH_0/3\pi$), which we apply to the SPARC database (175 galaxies). This rigid geometric prescription predicts rotation curves, the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR), and the linear scaling of Phantom Inertia with equal or higher precision than MOND phenomenology, without any fitting.

     \item \textbf{Dark Lensing:}  we extend this framework to the gravitational lensing of "dark" potentials showing that the same Phantom Inertia responsible for galactic dynamics, also stands behind the "dark lensing" phenomena.

     \item \textbf{Wide Binary Stars:} applied to this dynamic systems the theory correctly predicts the kinetic resonance scale ($a_{\beta} = cH_0/6\pi$) matching recent Gaia DR3 within observational uncertainties. 
 \end{enumerate}

These results demonstrate that a single geometric ontology, devoid of hidden mass or energy sectors, universally predicts empirical data across 20 orders of magnitude. This strongly suggests that the paradigm of "Dark" phenomenology is becoming obsolete, superseded by a transparent \textbf{Relational Geometric Ontology

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px; line-height: 1.6;">
        From the foundational principle \textbf{SPACETIME $\equiv$ ENERGY}, we derive the complete structure of the hydrogen atom. By enforcing geometric and topological closure, we demonstrate that quantization is not a separate postulate but an inevitable consequence of a self-consistent relational system. This framework derives the Bohr radius, the quantized energy levels, and reveals the fine structure constant, $\alpha$, to be  kinetic projection parameter, $\beta$, of the electron in its ground state. The derivation requires no classical force analogues, probabilistic wavefunctions, or differential equations, establishing atomic structure as a direct manifestation of relational geometry.
