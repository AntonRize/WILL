## About The Project

"WILL Geometry" is a comprehensive theoretical physics model that builds on principles of relationalism, epistemic hygiene and makes no ontological commitments. 

## Nothing is assumed. Everything is derived.

All physical quantities, including space, time, mass, and energy, must emerge directly from relational geometry and causal structure, eliminating the need for arbitrary constants or abstract entities. This research, conducted by Anton Rize, presents an attempt to derive a more general and parsimonious alternative to General Relativity, Cosmology, and Quantum Mechanics.

## Key Results

### Solving the Galactic Rotation Problem

This framework provides a novel solution to the galactic rotation problem using only the observed baryonic matter. Testing on the SPARC dataset (175 galaxies) shows a strong fit (RMSE = 20.3 km/s) without invoking dark matter and without free parameters.

**[Test it yourself with the interactive rotation curve calculator](https://antonrize.github.io/WILL/calculator/)**

### One Input Cosmology

The entire standard cosmological model is replaced by an algebraic system that requires only one input parameter to set the scale (e.g., $H_0$). All other quantities, including the cosmic energy budget ($\Omega_{\Lambda} \approx 2/3$), are predictions of the model, with NO adjustable parameters.

*Results above are not an isolated trick, but a natural consequence of a more fundamental framework derived from a single hypothesis:*

## Fundamental Hypothesis

$$\boxed{SPACETIME \equiv ENERGY}$$
 
From this single hypothesis, without free parameters, we derive:

### Part I: Relativistic Foundations
<details>
    <summary>1. Geometric Derivation of Fundamental Physics (SR & GR).</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> The key equations of Special Relativity ($E=mc^2$) and the fundamental relationship between gravity and kinematics in GR ($\kappa^2 = 2\beta^2$) are derived <strong>ab initio</strong> from the geometry and topology of closed systems. The theory does not describe physics; it generates it.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>2. The Energy Symmetry Law as a New Principle of Causality.</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> A new fundamental law ($\Delta E_{A \to C} + \Delta E_{C \to A} = 0$) is introduced, ensuring energy balance between observers. It explains the speed of light limit as the boundary for preserving this symmetry, giving it a physical, rather than a merely postulated, meaning.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>3. The Unified Field Equation: Solving GR's Core Problems.</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> The complexity of GR is replaced by a single algebraic relation ($\kappa^2 = R_s/r_d = \rho/\rho_{max}$). This solves the long-standing problem of defining local energy density and eliminates singularities by construction, as observable non rotating curvature and density are intrinsically bounded ($\kappa^2 \le 1$).</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>4. Prediction of Critical Orbits from Geometric Equilibrium.</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> The radii of the Photon Sphere ($1.5R_s$) and the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO, $3R_s$) emerge not as special solutions to equations of motion, but as a direct consequence of the system's internal geometric equilibrium, where the projection angles $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ become equal.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>5. Drastic Simplification of the Mathematical Apparatus.</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> The entire complex machinery of differential geometry and tensor calculus used in GR is replaced by a closed system of simple algebraic equations. This reduces computational complexity by up to 95% and makes the theory fundamentally more transparent and intuitive.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>6. High-Precision Empirical Confirmation.</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> The model has been tested against real-world data. It accurately predicts the relativistic corrections for GPS satellites (matching the observed 38.52 \(\mu\)s/day time shift) and the precession of Mercury's orbit (discrepancy with GR is a mere $2.19 \times 10^{-10}\%$).</p>
    </div>
</details>

### Part II: Cosmology

<h3>Core Predictions & Established Results</h3>
<p><i>(These results are direct, mathematically rigorous consequences of the framework and/or are confirmed by empirical data.)</i></p>

<details>
    <summary>1. A "One-Parameter" Cosmology: Replacing the Î›CDM Model.</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> The entire standard cosmological model is replaced by an algebraic system that requires only <strong>one input parameter to set the scale</strong> (e.g., $H_0$). All other quantities, including the cosmic energy budget ($\Omega_\Lambda \approx 2/3$), are <strong>predictions</strong> of the model, not adjustable parameters.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>2. Solving the Galactic Rotation Problem without Dark Matter.</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> The model accurately predicts galactic rotation curves using only the observed baryonic matter. Testing on the SPARC dataset (175 galaxies) shows a strong fit (RMSE = 20.3 km/s) <strong>without invoking dark matter and without free parameters.</strong></p>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>3. Deriving the Dark Energy Equation of State ($w=-1$) from First Principles.</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> The equation of state $w=-1$ is not postulated but is <strong>derived</strong> as a necessary consequence of the principle of maximal global symmetry, where forces in a closed universe must be perfectly balanced.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<h3>Fundamental Theoretical Implications</h3>
<p><i>(These points represent deep theoretical conclusions of the model that shift the understanding of fundamental concepts.)</i></p>

<details>
    <summary>4. The Nature of "Dark Energy": A Geometric Consequence of Information Loss.</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> "Dark Energy" is explained not as a substance but as a <strong>geometric effect of irreversible information loss</strong> (of $\kappa^2$ projections) across cosmological horizons.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>5. The Origin of Entropy and the Arrow of Time.</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Entropy ($S = A/4l_P^2$) and the irreversibility of time are given a clear physical origin: they are consequences of the breaking of the Energy Symmetry Law.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>6. The "Zeno Cascade" and a Solution to the Information Paradox.</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> A new model for the internal structure of black holes is proposed as a "holographic Zeno cascade" of nested horizons. This resolves the information loss paradox: information is not destroyed but is hierarchically redistributed across layers down to the Planck scale.</p>
    </div>
</details>


<h3>Strong Hypotheses & Ongoing Research</h3>
<p><i>(These hypotheses are natural consequences of the model that are under active investigation.)</i></p>

<details>
    <summary>7. The Origin of Inertia: Mach's Principle from First Principles.</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> Inertia and local gravity are not fundamental forces but are <strong>emergent relativistic effects</strong>, arising from the difference between the local ($H(r) = c/r$) and global ($H_0$) rate of spatial transformation. Gravitational waves are dynamic modulations of this frequency.</p>
        <p class="status">Status: This conclusion is a direct interpretation of the derived equations and is under active theoretical review.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>8. Redshift as a Geometric Projection.</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> The observed cosmological redshift is not a Doppler effect from expansion but a <strong>geometric distortion</strong> due to our observational position within a hierarchy of causal horizons.</p>
         <p class="status">Status: This conclusion is a direct interpretation of the derived equations and is under active theoretical review.</p>
    </div>
</details>

### Part III: Quantum Mechanics
<details>
    <summary>1. The Origin of Decoherence from the Energy Symmetry Law.</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> A physical mechanism for quantum decoherence is proposed. Coherent superpositions are possible only for isolated systems. The moment a system interacts with any external object (e.g., a detector), the Energy Symmetry Law ($\Delta E_{A \to C} + \Delta E_{C \to A} = 0$) forces it into a single, definite energetic state. This "collapse" is not a mystery, but a geometric-energetic necessity.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>2. Geometric Origin of Quantization.</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Quantization is shown to be a consequence of a simple geometric condition ($n\lambda = 2\pi r$), not a separate quantum postulate. This replaces the need for a probabilistic wave function with topological self-consistency.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>3. Physical Meaning of the Fine Structure Constant ($\alpha$).</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> The model provides a physical identity for one of nature's most mysterious numbers. The fine structure constant, $\alpha$, is derived as being identical to the kinetic projection parameter ($\beta$) for the ground state of the hydrogen atom.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>4. Topological Explanation for Quantum Numbers and Fine Structure.</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> Quantum numbers ($n, l, m$) are reinterpreted as topological winding numbers for orthogonal electric and magnetic phase cycles. This naturally explains selection rules and the origin of fine structure splitting without invoking "spin."</p>
        <p class="status">Status: This is a recent result and its full implications are still under active investigation.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>5. Solution to the Electron Collapse Paradox.</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> The stability of the atom is shown to be a topological necessity. The state $n=0$ is not an electron on the nucleus, but the complete absence of a closed energetic projection. The electron cannot "collapse" because that would mean it ceases to exist as a structured entity.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>6. Unification of GR, Cosmology, and QM.</summary>
    <div class="details-content">
        <p><strong>Result:</strong> The same algebraic projection geometry ($\kappa$ and $\beta$) that describes cosmological dynamics and black hole orbits is shown to govern atomic structure, demonstrating a deep, underlying unity across all scales of physics.</p>
    </div>
