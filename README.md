# WILL Geometry: A Unified Physics Framework

**Live demonstration and documentation: [https://antonrize.github.io/WILL/](https://antonrize.github.io/WILL/)**

## About The Project

"WILL Geometry" is a comprehensive theoretical physics model that build on principles of relationalism, epistemic hygiene and makes no ontological commitments. 

## Nothing is assumed. Everything is derived.

All physical quantities, including space, time, mass, and energy, must emerge directly from relational geometry and causal structure, eliminating the need for arbitrary constants or abstract entities.
This research, conducted by Anton Rize, presents a more general and parsimonious alternative to General Relativity, Cosmology and Quantum Mechanics.

## Fundamental Postulate

$$\boxed{\text{SPACETIME} \equiv \text{ENERGY EVOLUTION}}$$

From this single postulate, without free parameters, we derive:

Part I: Relativistic Foundations
1. Geometric Derivation of Fundamental Physics (SR & GR).
2. The Energy Symmetry Law as a New Principle of Causality.
3. The Unified Field Equation: Solving GR's Core Problems.
4. Prediction of Critical Orbits from Geometric Equilibrium.
5. Drastic Simplification of the Mathematical Apparatus.
6. High-Precision Empirical Confirmation.

Part II: Cosmology
1. A "One-Parameter" Cosmology: Replacing the ΛCDM Model.
2. Solving the Galactic Rotation Problem without Dark Matter.
3. Deriving the Dark Energy Equation of State ($w = - 1$) from First Principles.
4. The Nature of "Dark Energy": A Geometric Consequence of Information Loss.
5. The Origin of Entropy and the Arrow of Time.
6. The "Zeno Cascade" and a Solution to the Information Paradox.
7. The Origin of Inertia: Mach's Principle from First Principles.
8. Redshift as a Geometric Projection.

Part III: Quantum Mechanics
1. The Origin of Decoherence from the Energy Symmetry Law.
2. Geometric Origin of Quantization.
3. Physical Meaning of the Fine Structure Constant ($\alpha$).
4. Topological Explanation for Quantum Numbers and Fine Structure.
5. Solution to the Electron Collapse Paradox.
6. Unification of GR, Cosmology, and QM.
